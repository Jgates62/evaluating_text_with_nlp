MTB,g512qr,Beginner needs advice for new wheels,"A few years ago my mountain bike's wheels where stolen (shown below) and I recently gotten it out of my storage unit with hopes to ride it again. I'm a complete beginner however and only ridden it a few times before the wheels got stolen so I don't know where to begin with replacing everything (tires/rims) so I'm hoping I can get some advice here. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a Cannondale Super V 1000. Looking at it's original specs it seems that the rims it came with where  ' **Sun Rims CR18, 32-hole** ' and ' **26 x 2.10inch IRC Mythos XC kevlar** ' tires according to this link ( [https://www.bicyclebluebook.com/value-guide/product/67775/](https://www.bicyclebluebook.com/value-guide/product/67775/) ).  Since this is an older bike I'm curious if I should buy the same rims and tires it came with or get a different set? I'm skeptical to buy other set since I'm not exactly sure what will fix this bike or not, any advice would be very appreciated!

I am looking for a MTB (obviously!). I am coming from BMX, been riding a few years. I want a mountainbike to ride various local trails and whatever i can find in the woods. Jumps, drops, technical and fast trails is what i want to be riding.

I want a 27.5"" wheel hard tail bike, max budget of $1200, no higher (CANADIAN DOLLARS!)

I know kinda what i like from BMX, i like a responsive aggressive frame, short back end. I am 5'10"" and 140-150lbs, thinking a medium frame.

My preferred local shop sells norco and is building up a fluid HT 3 (medium) to see tomorrow. Another shop in town sells giant and specialized I believe.

I was considering the Kona Blast ($1199 cad), norco fluid 3 ht ($1199 cad), giant talon 1 ($1199 cad), specialized pitch expert 1x($1099 cad). How do these bikes all compare?

I want a 1x drivetrain which all these bikes have i believe. I am leaning towards the The norco because it has plus wheels/tires which is nice, would like to put 3"" tires on in the winter and the frame seems aggressive and most similar to my bmx (s&amp;m holy diver). But it has coil fork where as some of these bikes have air forks. 

Any suggestions? which of these is the most aggressive sized frame? I want a responsive, aggressive frame and ability to beat it up in trails."

MTB,g4w2a5,Fox 34 float on stock Karate Monkey: 27.5 or 29?,"I was looking at the 130mm (910-20-785) or 140mm (910-20-783) Fox Float 34 Factory in 27.5. However, the Q&amp;A section on Surly's site recommends running suspension with a 51mm rake with the Karate Monkey, and those have a 44mm rake. The 51mm rake is only on the their 29's, so I am now looking at those in 130mm (910-20-718) or 140mm (910-20-713). It's for a rigid 2019 KM, and I plan on running the 27.5+ wheels that come stock, but it would be nice to have the option to run 29s down the road. Is there any real downside to going with the 29 forks? From what I've been able to find online I THINK the 27.5x3 Dirt Wizards will fit fine. Anybody have experience with these forks on a 27.5+?

I found 2016 specs that say the 29s should fit 27.5x3 while the 27.5s will fit up to 27.5x3.25. I don't know if that still applies to 2020 models. Source: [https://www.ridefox.com/fox17/help.php?m=bike&amp;id=804](https://www.ridefox.com/fox17/help.php?m=bike&amp;id=804)

It's also worth mentioning that I'm exclusively considering the 2020 Fox Floats because I can get a substantial discount on them. I'm completely new to all of this, so any info/suggestions is appreciated. I'll likely be riding mostly single track in the southwest, and maybe a few weekend bikepacking trips.

MTB,g4sl99,Need Advice on a budget (used) trail bike,"I got into mtb last year and picked up a hardtail 29er for cardio and cross-training for my dirt bikes. That bike has been good to me for exercise, but the trails by me (northeast) are pretty rocky/rooted and I find myself being more aggressive on descents and drops/jumps, and missing the playfulness of the suspension on my dirtbikes. So on to a full squish mtb. Unfortunately, I am completely lost when it comes to MTB brands and components... 

I figure I don't need an enduro, cus I won't be traveling to bike parks. Mostly I ride the trails nearby Boston, like the western greenway, Burlington landlocked forest, and Lynn woods. I do know that I don't want another 29er. 

What's a good trail bike that will be fun going fast over rocks/drops/small jumps, and will still be a decent pedaller? Fast climbing is not a priority really, but I don't want to punish myself. I have a budget of $2200 from a recent dirt bike sale, but would really like to keep this cheap... say under $1500. I don't mind riding an older bike if I find one in good shape. So, what should I be looking for?

Sorry for the wall of text.

MTB,g4s8mb,"PSA: for short riders on 29ers that want a more aggressive posture/handlebar height, Syntace Flatforce is the best stem","I like my bars about even height with my seat as an XC rider, maybe even a tad lower. So I have to run a negative stem as I am quite short. 

I have tried about 4 stems thus far and have settled on the Syntace Flatforce being the best for my fit needs. First I was riding a -17 and -25 stem, which were just regular stems flipped upside down. Then I tried one other from Scott/Syncros which was meant to be run negative but still felt awkward. Then I bought the Syntace just to try it out and it is the best. It has what feels to be normal handling while still being ultra low. I am guessing its the engineering of the drop/offset they use. 

So, if you are short and want your bars low try the syntace flatforce stem. I also noticed that FSA makes a similar one that I did not buy. Could also be a good option."

MTB,g43iq4,Steep STA trail bike for a XL rider,"Hi,

I am currently planning on getting a privateer 161 and keeping my jeffsy 29 Al base 2019, but I ride mainly in Denmark, so I thought that maybe a full on ripper of a trail bike would be better than having a trail bike I am okay with and a full on enduro rig, since there isn't the most use for full on enduro here. 

My main gripe with the jeffsy and really most trail bikes is the STA, I ride a XL and I more often than not run the dropper 4cm out of the seat post, so my ass always ends up over the rear axle when I sit and pedal.

What are some agressive trails bikes that have 120-140mm of travel, a 64-66 HTA and a 77-80 STA (the steeper the actual STA the better too), my total budget would come up to around 4700€ if I sell my jeffsy and drop the privateer. (Ofcourse the cheaper the better)

MTB,g41ln4,"Looking for advice from someone smarter than me about designing a quick, efficient, full-body, mountain bike specific strength training workout.","Hey guys, I'm finally trying to do what I should have been doing long ago and that's strength training to improve my mountain biking. I never do it because I'd rather ride. I feel like I've plateaued a bit and I really need to get over the hump. Anyway, I'm a little overwhelmed by separating the good advice from the bad advice on Google searches so I'd like to ask you guys. I'm looking to design something that's quick and efficient, like once or twice a week. It would be nice if it didn't crush me because I, you know, would rather be riding. The deficiencies I want to attack are my power in general, mashing in a standing position (I can climb sitting for days, but am usually too fatigued to even attempt getting out of the saddle on a climb) and an occasional very sore low back on downhills that sometimes really detracts from my fun. I could almost guarantee strengthening my core and hips would be excellent for all of these deficiencies, but there's so many exercises to choose from that it's hard to know what's best for mountain biking specifically. Right now the equipment I have is 3 sets of dumbbells with hundreds of pounds of weights, a bench, and an exercise ball. No barbell. I have a history of strength training but I've usually just stuck to compound movements in the past (squats, bench, shoulder press, etc). I'd love to explore more functional movements for biking, single leg exercises, core exercises, plyometrics, etc, but at the same time I don't want to complicate things too much. Share your workouts, Reddit! Any advice or tips would be much appreciated. Thanks."

Now I found a great deal for a barely used Rockshox Recon Silver TK Air. Problem is: It has 120 mm of travel and is designed for 27,5 "" wheels. 

The question is: How much would raising the front by aprox 50 mm (height gain thru added travel at given headtube angle and added front axle height thru larger wheel radius) screw up my geometry? 

I always felt like the front of this bike was too low, so that's not an issue, but I fear that this might shift the seattube and thus the centre of mass on climbs too far back. And the BB on this bike isn't particularly low as-is now either."

MTB,g3vk7a,Every time I ride I think about how biking is the perfect metaphor for life,"Sometimes its a lot of work, sometimes it's the greatest thrill ever. Sometimes you feel like you're crawling along, everyone is passing you by, and you're the last person to get to the top. Sometimes you're absolutely invincible and no one can stop you. Sometimes you fall and get some bumps and bruises, but you always get back up and keep pedaling. Sometimes going up feels like a breeze and sometimes going down can feel like a chore and you have no idea what you're actually doing. But we all keep on going, getting better and better every time. Sometimes we don't even want to ride but we go anyways, sometimes we don't. Sometimes you have to take that leap of faith and you land it, feeling on top of the world. Other times you take that leap of faith and eat shit but you get back up and try again and again and again until it's perfect only to come back a week later just to fall again. But everytime we make that climb back up to the top, shake our head and think god dammit I can do this. All of the hard work, broken pieces, sweat, blood, and tears leads up to that one moment when you're flying and feel like absolutely nothing can stop you. Without all the hardship that moment wouldn't be nearly as satisfying and that's why we all just have to keep on pedaling."

MTB,g3tit4,Shifter quit working with faceplate on SRAM NX Eagle 1x12,"So I was riding the other day and my bike suddenly wouldn't shift out of 3rd gear, like the shifter was stuck, not the derailleur. I came home and opened the face plate to the shifter and saw the shifter cable wasn't in the groove. Long story short, I ended up replacing the entire shifter cable.

So now I've got my shifter hanging off my bike, and the bike is shifting through all the gears fine when the shifter isn't attached to the faceplate. I've tried several times where I attach the shifter back to the face plate and it'll go through the gears fine one go through and then quits working; i'll go from 1 to 12, then 12 back to 1 and once it gets to the 1st gear the shifter quits working. I can't go back down the gears.

At first I thought it was the same problem, where the cable was coming out of the groove inside the shifter. But I've detached the faceplate and the cable is still in the groove, and once detached it starts shifting again.

I've noticed the spring itself seems to be falling out of its groove as I go up the gears, and seems a little loose. I'm not sure if that's normal, this is the first time I've messed with my shifter and rerouted my shifter cable.

Anyone got any idea?

EDIT: When I put the spring back in the groove it quits shifting again. Not sure what that means"

MTB,g3skxv,"Ohlins suspension, or how I was lied to by the MTB media","This is going to be a little bit of a rant, so...

TL;DR - All the MTB reviewers talk about Ohlins' forks like they are hard to setup and not worth it unless you have a full time tech at your disposal. They are full of it and must be trying to protect Fox and RockShox, because this is some good stuff.

Over the last five years I've had the pleasure of buying and working on multiple bikes for my wife, kids and self. I've worked on Suntour, X-Fusion, Fox and Rockshox suspension components and never had a ton to complain about (other than quality control of certain models), just the basic you get what you pay for issues.

So this year while shopping for my next trail slayer, my LBS had one of [these](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/enduro-pro-29-6fattie/p/129273?color=240149-129273) in stock, in my size, but most importantly in my budget.

I started my research on everything, especially the suspension. I was surprised when the reviews I was reading were mixed at best, especially for the RXF 36 fork. [Bike Radar](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/ohlins-rxf-36-evo-fork-review/) gave it 2.5 stars, [Worldwide Cyclery said it was for racers only](https://www.worldwidecyclery.com/blogs/worldwide-cyclery-blog/product-review-ohlins-rxf-36-review). The worst was [this supposed complete mega-test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV6d1LX0SkU).

So it was with some trepidation that I went into my LBS last week and paid thousands of dollars for bike that had everything I wanted, but a suspect fork.

**First ride**

I took it to a local trail that has a good varied climb with defined sections (rocky, rooty, sandy) and descent that is just as varied. My first thought was that the fork was silkier in the small bump compliance than any fork I'd ever ridden, but was blowing through its travel too quickly for my taste. After that ride I knew I should add some pressure to the ramp up chamber.

Maybe I should have mentioned this earlier. Instead of using tokens like everyone else to reduce the volume in the air chamber in order to adjust the ramp curve, Öhlins uses a separate air chamber.

I couldn't find my shock pump (all the fathers out there with kids that work on their own bikes know my pain), so I didn't worry about it.

**Ride 2**

I decided to go on a ride with my wife still without having adjusted the fork's ramp up chamber. Now that I'm getting my bike legs back after a strange winter, I started to feel more comfortable and was pushing harder in the corners. Then I noticed it.

I was blowing through the travel way too quickly. As my speed increased, so did the rate at which I was blowing through the suspension.

When I got home I made a more determined search for my shock pump, but still didn't find it. So I went to the LBS and bought a new one. [This one even has a valve to keep you from loosing more air volume than necessary when you detach](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/air-tool-shock-pump/p/155576?color=230479-155576&amp;searchText=472E-3005). I got home and put it on the ramp up chamber.... 0, zero, nada, nothing... The monkeys at the LBS hadn't checked the ramp up chamber when they initially set the bike up for me. I hadn't known enough to check it myself.

So I put the recommended amount of air in (there is a nice sticker on the back of the fork leg telling you the recommended pressures for your weight) and voilà! Now I couldn't compress the fork with my own body weight and could actually feel the ramp up.

So I went out last night and tried again. Same trail, three times in a row. It kept 90% of the small bump sensitivity that it had prior to me adjusting the ramp up chamber, but was much more supportive in the mid-stroke and never even threatened to bottom out.

**Conclusion**

I am trying to understand how the MTB media screwed up so badly on this. I haven't seen any of the small bump compliance issues that they are complaining about (Bike Radar says on their website that their demo unit had a broken compression valve), off the top it's more supple than the RS Revelation that was on my StumpJumper and more supportive in the mid-stroke as well.

As far as the ""death grip"" and punishing on the hands thing that was mentioned by multiple outlets. I don't know how to take that and I have a sneaky suspicion it's because MTB reviewers tend to be of a single mold.

I am not in that mold. I am taller than average, more muscular than average and heavier than average. Is that why I don't have to be going at race speeds to appreciate the Öhlins RXF 36?

I don't know what the answer is, but I think it might lie somewhere in that area. A like of size diversity in component tests might be a more common issue than I originally had thought. We need more Clydesdale class testers.

Another thing that the media really screwed up on. Adjusting the Öhlins RXF 36 is much easier than doing the same on a Rockshox or Fox fork. On those brands you have to bleed the air out and then remove the top cap to add or remove tokens, then replace the cap and re-pressurize. This is nowhere near ideal to me. It was because of this that bought an MRP Control Cartridge for the Revelation I was running last year, but that had it's own set of issues.

What is easier (and more tuneable) than two air chambers that can be adjusted in moments with a simple shock pump? When my favorite short course opens up I will be doing laps and adjusting those pressures in between to dial in my settings, something I would never have considered doing with token based system."

MTB,g3rqsu,Itch to upgrade components,"Last year I bought my first enduro in well over a decade to get back into some endurance/downhill again.

I spent a weekend there mostly doing blue routes with the odd black thrown in as I got more comfortable back in the saddle. One thing became abundantly clear to me, in my older age, I much prefer going down than up. As a result, I'm looking to sell my Fox DPX2 and replace it with a DHX2. For the forks, I've put in 2 volume spacers in the forks but I'm not sure if I like it too much as they are a bit too tough on progression but I'll test more once the season opens back up. One thing I'm desperate to do as well is get in touch with some suspension guru's and get some advice on how best to set them up. I've started with reference suggestions by Fox and adjusted slightly to my liking. But even then, it's miles off what I'd consider 'setup'. So reach out if you're able to help or know anyone in the Bay Area in CA.

For those initiated in today's tech, what would you replace and why on the above bike? I've just an itch to turn this bike more into a DH bike than enduro.

That being said, I absolutely love the bike, I went for it due to me riding hard on the crank and it got great reviews for being able to take a beating.

I have a fat bike (just hear me out) and I'm struggling to do stuff I used to do ok on my hard tail someone stole my hard tail and that left me with just my fat bike and I can't seem to bunny hop or manual without front suspension. My fat bike has no Sus at all so my only way to get a little pump is to reduce the tire pressure.

I know this is a somewhat self inflicted issue but it's the only bike I have to ride."
MTB,g3e5rz,How would you upgrade my old HT?,"So I just bought an Orbea Occam, which I am very happy with. It's my first FS bike and replaces my 2013 Marin Bobcat Trail hardtail. 

I'm hanging on to the Marin, as I want to have it as a backup bike, but I would like to make some changes / upgrades to it. 

[Here's a link to the bike / parts list](https://www.rei.com/product/845678/marin-bobcat-trail-29er-bike-2013)

As far as changes go, I'd like to make it into more of an XC-oriented bike (which is sort of was already).

The first thing I want to change is the drivetrain, as the current one is not great and has been the thing that has bothered me most. 

As far as other parts, I'm fine with the brakes. They work well enough, so no need to upgrade there. I'll probably add a dropper post.

Any advice on a decent, inexpensive 1x drivetrain? And if you were to spend lets say, $3-400 max to make this a better bike, what would you do? Used / better fork? New tires? etc. Would love to see what people think.

Thank in advance for any help!"

From their point of view I can certainly see that advantage with the seat dropped when you have to ride off it or bail, but standing up and pedaling on a skinny always seemed more unstable than seated.

MTB,g2t1nh,1Up Super Duty vs Equip-D. Anyone owned both?,"Hi,

I've been mountain biking since 1995 and have always used a roof rack. I've had the same Thule Aeroblades about 10 years (Jetta Sportwagen) and am currently using 3 of the Rocky Mounts Tomahawk mounts. They have been great but I'm tired of cleaning bugs off my bike on long trips.

I just bought a new VW (Alltrack) and installed a 2"" hitch on it last weekend with the intention of finally getting a 1Up rack; a single along with 1 or 2 add-ons.

I can't decide between the newer Equip-D or the trusty Super Duty. I really prefer the looks of the raw looking aluminum (I knows its silver anodized) and am concerned the black will fade on the Equip-D as others have reported.

Wish the made the Equip-D in silver but they don't.

Is the Equip-D that much of an upgrade over the older Super Duty? The front release does seem nice but, most of the time, I'll just have 1 or 2 mounts installed so the release on the Super Duty shouldn't be that hard to reach.

Thanks!"

Hi all, mid 30’s here, was big on biking when younger but following a serious medical condition in my late teens I lost the ability to do most sports. 

Anyhow, here I am now with a cheapo MTB I picked up used and have restored and upgraded to a spec I find really nice to ride. It’s a fairly basic 26” hardtail with 3x8 gearing, upgrades include wider bars, larger range cassette, hydraulic brakes, better shifters, schwable tyres. It rides great, unfortunately I don’t!

Due to the health issues I had in my teenage years I have quite a reduced lung capacity so find it really difficult to get a good stride going, it’s very easy for me to over do things and end up light headed and struggling for breath. 

Given this can you help advise what exercises or routines I could do to help me get bike fit? I don’t want to be able to do 20+ mile trails, my local loop is only a couple of miles and i would love to be able to attack it flat out without having to stop after a mile!

MTB,g2m40r,New Bike: Direct to Consumer or Used?,"Long story short, my Vitus Sommet was stolen during a trip, and I need a new bike. In the past I've always bought used, since I'm a broke grad student (got a stupid deal on my last bike, built it up), but my insurance paid me $3k towards my new bike. I started looking at used bikes, and realized that I could potentially buy one new. I can't stomach the poor value of bikes at bike shops, and am pretty comfortable doing a majority of my bike work, so I would go direct to consumer (Commencal, Jeffsy) or buy used again.

Basically I narrowed it down to four bikes. Looking to go with less travel this time around, I want to prioritize a bike that's playful (come from a background doing dirt jumps). Would maybe consider a hardtail, but I think having a dirt jumper and hardtail is a bit of an overlap.

Basically, even though I'm broke, I want to blow all of my hard earned insurance payment on a new bike. Here's the options, in no particular order, open to any suggestions of your favorite bike. I don't want something too long, especially in the chain stay, so don't come at me with any pseudo-DH sleds.

1. New: 2020 Commencal Meta TR, some variant
2. New: 2020 Jeffsy Comp (too much travel, imo)

I am 6’3” 225 lbs. I have an XL frame (hardtail) with 29x2.25 mountain tires. The tires are 1 year old and have decent aggressive treads.

I pumped my tires up to 40 PSI before I went for a ride this morning. 

I had fun, but felt like I was slipping more than usual. The slipping was mostly in the rear tire.

I saw a chart online that said for my weight and tires, I should ride at 33-34 PSI.

Chart is here:
https://mbaction.com/Uploads/Public/Images/Product%20News/Screen%20shot%202011-10-11%20at%201.55.33%20PM.jpg

Is 40 PSI high enough to be causing the slipping for sure? 

I didn’t have the best ride today (I was tired and felt like I couldn’t find the confident groove). Can’t tell if the PSI is really too high or if I was slipping because it was a little wet today.

Even at 40 PSI, when I sit on the bike, and look down at the tires, I can notice them “squishing” a bit.

Is that okay? Should the squish be visible? I like riding fast but also want traction. Wondering what you guys think!

MTB,g2azhi,So bike fit for a guy with short legs and long torso. Large or medium?,"So as I plan to buy a new bike( based on the cost increase that might come or not) I would like for that expensive purchase to be perfect. 

So I have historically always bought Large frames. It’s mostly been recommended for me. Probably because I am 180cm (that’s 5.11 I think) and I guess that is just into Large size chart area. So pretty easy for local bike shop to recommend that without thinking much about it. 

I have tried smaller bikes and I once tried a small I got for free and that was scary as fuck. I felt I was about to go over the handlebar all the time. 

But my body is probably not a bike body. I have relatively short legs compared to my torso. In addition my arms are not short. I would say that they are long, meaning they match my torso. 

My current Large frame bike is a relatively good fit stable wise. It is very stable. But I do feel it’s hard to handle. I do feel it’s a little big but since it’s stable it feels safe going downhill etc. 

I do run a short stem on it. 35 mm I think it is and a relatively wide bar. 

So my question. 

What measures are most important in terms of bike fit? I have read about inseam but I honestly don’t know what that is etc. 

I think I once had a M/L bike. But I think that frame size is uncommon and it’s certainly not part of Trek size chart. I do remember that I loved that size although it was not a mountain bike so.

I did attempt to measure my so-called inseam. I measured in cm from my “are between ass and jewels;)” and I got 84cm. I am not sure if one measure from where pants crotch start or that special place but In jeans I normally go for 32 inch length but can easily wear 33 inch too.

My ape index is 1.04 so I do have a fairly long reach for my height. Probably also why I feel cramped if the bike is to small."

The leak it quite fast, the tire won't really hold pressure at all. I have been reading about similar issues and it seems that often a leak from around the valve indicated the leak is actually occurring due to the tubeless tape, but the amount of air coming out seems a bit much to be from the tape (you can hear and feel a lot of air coming out).


Is there any way of telling if the tape is the culprit? Some of it seems to peel a little bit at the edges but it sits nice and snug with the rim if I don't touch it. I want to avoid removing the manufacturer installed tape and replacing it only to find the problem still persists. If it isn't the tape does anyone know a way to get the valve to seal up properly?"

Now I'm looking at getting a new bike and hopefully getting out and riding this summer.

I live southeast of Seattle (Renton specifically) and I'm torn on what style of FS bike I should be looking at.  My last bike was the aforementioned Pitch Pro and although I loved it in general, in hindsight I would have liked something a little more pedal friendly.  However, at the time I was living in San Diego and a lot of the trails I was riding were closer to XC loops than what I would call ""enduro"" trails.

So with that in mind, I'm wondering if a 5"" travel trail bike or a 6"" more enduro style bike is a better buy for riding around Seattle/Western WA.  I do love downhill (I've got a BMX background), but I usually prefer longer rides with a little bit of everything.  I don't plan on hitting any lift served parks with this bike - if I do end up going to Stevens or Whistler, I'd probably just demo a true DH bike and slog on that.

MTB,g1e2fh,Travel RS Sektor to flatten the head angle,"Hey guys,

maybe someone can help me. 
I got a Cube Reaction TM Pro. It's supposed to be a trail Hardtail and so do I use it. Actually it has 130mm travel (Rock Shox Sektor) and I'm considering to use the option of travelling it up to 150mm by removing an all travel spacer.

My thoughts are coming from the idea of flattening the head angle to get a better downhill performance. Now, with the 130mm, the head angle is 67°. By travelling the fork it would be 65°. Also I would get a little wider wheelbase and a higher crankset - which seems to be positive. I know that the uphill performance would suffer a little bit. But that's not what I'm worried about. 

The point I'm worried about the most is that the forks stanchions are too thin with 32mm.

MTB,g1ccch,How do you upgrade your MTB? (order),"Hey everyone, 

*(intro)* So I'm pretty new to MTB I just bought my first bike in December, a 2016 specialized Enduro and I'm absolutely in love with it. Before this, I was and still am an avid BMX rider and had always found joy in working on my own bike, but as expected I'm running into issues that I previously never had to deal with in BMX repair/ maintenance.

***(The Real question)*** So my main question is when upgrading my MTB what problems should I look out for in the order in which I upgrade my bike. The end goal for me is to take all the parts I upgrade on my specialized and swap them on a newer nicer frame (this is usually a cakewalk for BMX because most part sizes are universal). One issue I ran into is when looking at upgrading my wheelset I discovered there are many different axles (My axle being the standard 100mm front and 142mm rear), but after further reading, it looks like a new frame might have the newer boost 110mm front and 148mm rear. While I don't mind having last year's hub length (given I could just buy adaptors) I worry about the fitment on other parts such as forks, rear shocks, cranks, etc. because they are heavy investments. So what order do you think my upgrades should go in? I believe my bike is mostly up to date, tubeless-ready160mm Rockshox pike fork with a Fox float DPS rear shock, and it even came with a nice dropper post which I don't think I could ever do without.

*(other important info)* So when it comes to bike building I love it just as much as love hitting the trails or the skatepark but another aspect of this is... IM BROKE. Some might say to leave suspension maintenance to the professionals at my local bike shop (I've been told this a lot) but I simply can't afford to buy the parts and also have someone else work on it, It is also my goal to reach every bearing and O-ring on this bike. While I do want to support my local bike shops but I tend to stick to the co-ops or at home because I can't go to the local Treck without leaving with a multi-hundred dollar bill (no offense to the treck guys they're extremely knowledgeable and really know what they're doing it just doesn't agree with my wallet)

*(not really related you can skip)* So sorry for the long post it is my first one so hopefully it doesn't get lost in the depths of Reddit. But I wanted to say thanks who all who post in this form or others. The MTB switch has been somewhat of a google nightmare but this form has helped me so much and in so many ways from repairs to parts, and even protective equipment, so thanks to everyone from mods to OP's to commenters and even to that guy who missed it by a couple of months and got stuck at the bottom with no upvotes, shoutout to the lurkers to!!"
MTB,g1cap4,Would it be stupid to spend $650 on a 2003 Santa Cruz Blur?,"Hey Guys

I come from road riding and recently bought a rigid vintage steel MTB for bike packing. However I have found myself drooling over snappier bikes for riding single track for fun.

I am studying and hence my budget is limited. I have come across a Santa Cruz Blur XTR 2003. All in all it is in good condition but a little tired from 17 years of use of course.

I would use the bike for having fun on the single track and maybe some minor bikepacking trips, so I don't need the latest and the greatest. But is it stupid to buy something that old for $650?

Your opinion is most appreciated!

COVID has me wanting to get back into biking, since the gyms are closed and I am working from home inside all day. I was doing a ton of research last night and yesterday, and found three bikes I am interested in (CAD pricing). I wanted to get your thoughts on the bikes (one is really on sale). I am a 6'2.5 245lb rider.

MTB,g19vhd,Quick question about derailleur,"Recently i bought new a new bike, its been fantastic so far however the gears keep ""skipping"". When i shift it changes gears smoothly but if i put a lot of pressure (too high of gear) it sort of skips and causes me to jolt forward losing my momentum. This sometimes happens 2 or 3 times in row after changing the gears once.

Is there something i should focus on adjusting? I watched couple vids but im unceratin on what might actually be causing this and/or if i just need a new derailleur.

I was wondering if it is possible to add a clutch to to this bike? Or better return/cancel the order ( it hasn't been processed yet ) and wait for the VRS 2020 to be back on stock and order that one?

Edit : I Just noticed the title typo.., i meant ""Clutch or no clutch""..

MTB,g17d0v,How much would you pay for an upgraded suspension?,"Hi all, I am currently looking into buying a new Trailbike.

Since I am a student I have to really look what I am buying and what not. My favourite right now would be the Radon Slide but I am not sure which variant I should get. The key differences are in my opinion mostly the suspension.

The 8.0 variant comes with a RockShox Relevation RC fork and a RockShox Deluxe Select+ shock whereas the 9.0 comes with a Fox 36 Float Performance Elite fork and a Fox Float DPX2 Performance Elite shock. Of course also other components change but those to me are the most significant ones.

Prices for the 8.0 are roughly 2500 USD and for the 9.0 about 3300 USD.

Would you spend the extra 800 USD on the better suspension? A minor problem is that I really really like the looks of the 8.0 but the 9.0 just looks okay.So should I get a better bike that in my eyes looks worse or is the 8.0 suited well enough for some technical singletrails with occasional flow trail riding with small jumps?"
MTB,g14xu7,Alexrims EX30 rims hard to get tyre on,"I recently started with MTB and had the pleasure of having to replace my tube a couple of times.

My tires are Schwalbe Hans Dampf 29x2.6 and Alexrims EX30. I need a lot of force and patience to get the tyre off and on the rim. This can’t be normal.

MTB,g0znys,Designing a MTB Round 2!,"Greetings again. Thanks to everyone who responded to my first post about my project, the input has been wildly valuable. Like last time, the bike is still a work in progress and there are some critiques that I've got noted but haven't gotten to yet because I want to get bigger things like geometry/handling values out of the way first. I'm mostly looking for geometry feedback on whether the updates I made to my design based off the feedback I received previously are sufficient. I'd love to get any feedback I can though. Thanks for your time, I'm really enjoying doing this (:

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if ya'll got any tips on where I can shop for components I would really appreciate that. I still got a lot of work to do before I can really consider buying, but the gear really adds up and it'd be nice to start looking for deals now. I currently only own the fork and rear shock for the build so there's still a lot of stuff I need to get my hands on.

[Above is a picture of my math for calculating the center of mass. I had a friend use a tape measure to estimate the distance from the bottom bracket of my current bike to belly button height on me while standing and sitting in comfortable pedaling position. I averaged the two center of mass values regarding myself then combined them with the center of mass value solidworks gave me for the frame as you can see it in the screenshots above. Does my center of mass position seem reasonable? Should I bump the weight up for the bike? Solidworks says my model is 20lb which seems too light even though there are no wheels\/tires. I know my model is missing brakes\/drivetrain. It seems fairly reasonable to me since I am 6'2 and 200lb with riding gear.](https://preview.redd.it/y7wc0xmkvps41.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd087198b7d5211a45a1e3fa2dc7be6fa591f520)

&amp;#x200B;

[I'm a bit concerned with my bottom bracket height. I forgot what the height of the bottom bracket was from the original post before I edited it and replaced the picture with the original bb height that I was told was too low. The current bb height doesn't seem wildly low however when bottomed out the bb height drops to 169mm which sounds a bit crucial.](https://preview.redd.it/f4wzdg84wps41.png?width=1513&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c3140aad907eb821380a8bc2b6a28d544880c3c)

[I dropped the leverage ratio quite a bit and bumped the rear wheel travel up a hair.

MTB,g0yvkg,Is it worth rigging up a bottomless token setup or increasing travel on my fork?,"Because I'm stuck at home, I want to mess with my bike. And spend little to no money doing it. 

I have a 2019 Specialized Chisel Comp. The bike has a RockShox Judy Gold RL fork, 100mm of travel. Great 95% of the time. The bike handles and climbs very well. 

The only issue I have is it blows through the travel when I'm being aggressive, but regular trail riding it's pretty perfect, so I would like to avoid adding much more pressure. 

I think what I need is bottomless tokens that aren't available for this fork (30mm tubes). Since that is the case, I think I have a few options and would like some opinions on them. 

Either rig up bottomless tokens on my own (make on lathe out of delrin or 3d print) and adhesive them to my air spring cap or add oil to achieve the same thing. Has anyone done anything similar, and is there any reason why it wont work? What oil should you use?

The other option is to remove the all-travel spacer which will increase the travel to 120mm. How much will doing that mess up my riding experience? 

For reference I'm usually riding in Michigan (DTE, Poto etc), which is pretty tame and you do a lot of uphill work. Until last year I had an 80mm travel hard tail 26er so 100mm 29er feels like a downhill bike. 

Thanks. I know these questions might be fairly annoying or hard to answer."

I cannot move my shifter closer to my thumb without moving it to the other side of the brake clamp... that may make it too close. Any recommendations? Thanks!"
MTB,g0uu1c,Just went from 27.5x3.0 tires down to 27.5x2.8.

I ride a 2019 Specialized Fuse Comp (hardtail 120mm fork) in my 3.0 tires I generally ran about 15-16psi up front and 16-17psi out back. Just curious what PSI would be a good starting point. Tires are setup tubeless btw. Thanks!

Got a group of buddies helping me sift through websites to find good value but none of them have been riding for more than a year. Would appreciate some redditors opinions. Aware some of these might be overkill for a beginner but we're hoping I progress fast enough to take a trip to Whistler this summer (assuming it's safe to by then). Here's what I have so far. Would be buying second hand so not sure if that makes a difference. 

* Specialized Stumpjumper/Stumpjumper ST
* Kona Process 134/153
* Norco Sight/Range/Optic
* Giant Reign/Trance
* Trek Fuel

Open to any similar suggestions. So far the Stumpjumper sticks out to me as the one that's not too much bike for a beginner but good enough for Whistler. Could be totally wrong tho so any feedback is appreciated.

* 17' bumper pull trailer

Initially I'd purchased the hitch to go on the back of the trailer to mount the Thule there.  Once I started looking into I i realized it voided Thule warranty to mount on trailer (likely structural issues since the axel is further from the back on the trailer vs truck).

Last year we put blankets down in the trailer and jammed the bikes in there but that sucked for so many reasons.

MTB,g0p1h6,Painful feet when riding,"(edit, I use Fiveten Freeriders)

As the title states, my feet hurt when I'm riding and I want to fix that. It's an uncomfortable feeling, it really hurts and it messes up my riding. They start to hurt either when I'm pedalling hard for a long period, or when I'm doing longish downhills. So to narrow it down a bit, They don't hurt because of chatter, or because I'm overweight. (which i'm not btw)

Does anyone else have this problem, and if so, have you found a way get your feet stronger to stop the pain. So far I've worked out that riding more doesn't help and that I get almost the same pain when I'm going out for a run.

Another solution that I've come up with is different pedals. I'm running Crankbrothers Stamp 1 pedals which have a thick axle running through the centre which makes it so that most pressure is focussed right behind the front part of your foot where youre standing on. (idk the name of it, i'm not native english)

If anyone can help me, I would be very very thankful. Just like everyone, I have plenty of spare time to do foot exercises right now."

MTB,g0nb7i,How to regain confidence after an awfull crash ?,"Hi guys,

To start a little story about my history.
I am a roadie, last summer I crashed with my road bike going 80k/h.. I broke my collarbone, shoulder blade, 6 ribs and had a punctured lung.. to start again with cycling, I bought myself an 'starter' MTB for the suspension, at the time it was 6 years ago I ridden one (my former DS, when I tried to become a pro cyclist said I had to ride a cx bike in the winter instead of a MTB, cause a cx bike is closer to an road bike).


After some months I started to ride in the woods and on the tracks, I was enjoying myself more than the last 5 years I rode my bike.
I felt like a 6 year old buying candies, everytime I was on that bike.


Step by step I tried to up my game and improve my skills, untill the day I went to an real technical MTB track with a friend of me, the first long steep downhill I felt not really confident at the top, but then I thought, come on.. just send it! a lot of people have done this with no problem..
I survived *feeling* but I saw my friend falling pretty hard behind me..


Since that day I'm again scared of downhills..
The Corona Virus probably has a reason in it I skip downhills atm, but I'm afraid this skipping of downhills will lead into a problem even after this crisis is done..


What is the best way to regain my confidence again ?


Before my friends crashed, I was thinking about upgrading my bike and go for an agressive hardtail and do some local MTB races for fun, even during my road season, cause I feel an incredible amount of joy riding with an MTB.

But after that incident, I think, maybe I should buy a Full suspension to feel more secure going downhill, but I think my MTB tracks are to flat out here, but on the other hand, results wouldn't matter, so f*** speed ?



TL;DR
crashed my bike last summer, had a couple broken bones, bought an MTB, gained confidence, saw my friend falling, lost gained confidence. Tips?
Buying a FS bike instead of a hardtail a bit overboard for my reasonable flat roads?"

I'm 5' 11"" with a 32"" inseam (from floor), so a longer torso. My previous bike (stolen) was a medium Stumpjumper 650b. It was on the tighter end, but large was definitely too big.

Comparing Timber Med - Timber Large - Stump Med:

MTB,g0kjdu,Race Face Wheelsets: Turbine R 30 vs Aeffect R 30,"Hey Everyone, I'm going through my first full on build right now and I'm trying to get a better understanding of the components I'm shopping. If there's a better place for this kind of post just let me know and I can try again, but felt like this would be a good place to start.

I was able to get a killer deal on a 2018 YT Jeffsy carbon frame. My goal is to build towards having the highest quality components *for the money.* I will never be racing, so paying top dollar for all carbon components is not what I plan to do - I just want to put high quality components all throughout, while at the same time trying to find the best deals possible. I live in CO and will be doing a lot of trail riding, and taking the bike up to Trestle (fingers crossed for a semi-normal opening time this year).

I recently came across a set of used Race Face Turbine R 30 wheel sets that are being sold for $500 for the pair. My question is are these wheel sets really worth the extra money they? (I know they retail for almost double that, just don't get why). Jenson USA site is showing that I can get brand new Aeffect R 30's for $300 for both sets.

Should I snag these Turbines for roughly 50% off, or should I just go for the Aeffects and save $200?"

I am looking for a place in either New Zealand or Australia that will do dyno testing of a rear shock to characterize the damper. I have had one previously done locally however the person performing the test only supplied print outs of the data (force vs stroke velocity etc) and ideally I would like to have electronic copies of the results so I can perform my own post-processing. Unfortunately this person cannot perform what I require so I am reaching out here to see if anyone has someone they could recommend.

Some additional information: The rear shock is not being used for a mountain bike but a different engineering project hence the need for data. The rear shock is a Manitou McLeod 152 mm x 32 mm.

MTB,g02ef5,Turn HT into FS by swapping frames,"Hey there. Maybe someone out here possibly is able to help me out. 
Currently I'm riding on a Cube Reaction TM Pro [Link](https://www.cube.eu/2019/bikes/mountainbike/hardtail/reaction/cube-reaction-tm-pro-greynorange-2019/)

By riding many trails (and also getting up there by climbing uphill) I got stuck with the idea that a FS would fit more to what I'm riding, even though I know that I'm getting a better technique by riding the Hardtail. 

So, instead of buying a finished FS I got the idea to buy a Frameset to save some money. I know that it can cause many problems, that much parts I have may not fit. So I thought about getting a Frameset in which most of the parts on bike would fit. 

I found out, that if I can find a Frameset of a Cube Stereo 140, most of the parts fit perfectly. And I'm also able to travel my actual Fork up to 150mm just by removing a spacer. 

So, what do you guys think about the idea in general? What about the parts on my bike - do you think they are useless for a FS AM/Enduro Bike? 

Thank you and excuse me for my bad English :) German guy here"

MTB,fzui2d,Wheels gone out of true.. help,"Hi /mtb

I have a 2019 Giant trance CF with Carbon fibre wheel set. My problem is when I took off the tyres to clean out the old sealant and replace with some new stans. I put the tyres back on and seated them perfectly, put the wheels back on and the rims are buckled pretty bad, its defiantly the rims I can feel them if I place my finger in a fixed position. At first I thought it was the tyre not centred correctly so I massaged them and re seated them around 5 times with no luck. These wheels havent been touched at all since the bike is only a few months old.

TLDR; is it normal that my carbon wheels went out of true when popping the tyre off and on again?

MTB,fzoaan,Tire Search,"Hello all looking for some recommendations on tires.

Bike: Diamondback Release 27.5 130 mm rear travel/150mm fork

Wheels: DT Swiss XM421 with 25mm Internal width

Riding Style/Conditions:

So I am a midwest rider exclusively, 85% of my riding is in Chicagoland area trails which when dry (which is only time we can really ride) They are hardpack and fast-rolling trails. Roots and on a few select trails some sharp limestone rocks, but mostly just hardpacked dirt.  With that said 2-3 times a year, I make it to places like Copper Harbor, Marquette, Windrock, hopefully, Bentonville and Pisgah etc.

My current setup is 2.35 Maxxis Forekaster front and 2.35 Maxxis Ardent Race rear.   I'm actually extremely happy with this setup as it gave me a fast-rolling rear that stayed loose and a pretty solid front grip.  They were great on my local trails and held up to 3 or so trips to places like Copper which is some legit downhill/all-mountain type stuff.  If I road that all the time I'd obviously get something like a DHF/DHR setup, but that's not my main riding area, even though that time is what I value most.  I got my current setup in the middle of summer 2018, so they have about a season and a half on them.  I'm guessing between 500-750 miles on these tires.

Well, I was out for one of my early rides this season and got two punctures in my rear tire in one ride.  The first one essentially looked like a woodchip that somehow went right through the tire.  Luckily I was able to fix it with 2 tire plugs and keep riding. Later that ride I got a puncture right on the edge of the rim, but it may be due to not getting enough air in with my little hand pump and getting a pinch.  I was also able to plug that one...with that said, I now have at least 3-4 plugs in these tires and they seem to be getting towards the end of there life. I just wish they made them in a 2.4 or 2.5.  

So my first option, is just keeping this setup, and replace the rear with another Ardent Race. That's what I'm leaning towards now, but I wouldn't mind getting something slightly more durable and slightly bigger.  My frame can handle up to 2.6, but my internal rim width suggest I shouldn't go much above 2.4""

I was considering a Maxxis Minion SS in the rear, and sticking with the Forekaster for now, and when the front needs it maybe going with a DHF.

TLDR:  Looking for aggressive XC/Trail 2.35-2.5"" front tire and durable fast rolling rear for hardpack trails in same size range, I also take a few trips a year to places like Copper Harbor with sharp rocks and loose over hard conditions.  I'm really familiar with Maxxis lineup, but get overwhelmed when looking at other companies.  The Ardent appears to be a good option in terms of lineup position, but I've heard multiple different sources say it's not very confidence-inspiring tire. I'd maybe open to running it as a rear, but not a front.  


Suggestions would be appreciated.  I'm not a weight weenie by any means, but I mostly ride XC trails, so not looking for some 850g+ tire really."

MTB,fzkdvc,Aluminium or Carbon Spectral?,Sorry for the double post today but im just wondering. Ive done research and asked a few ppl but Im still stuck. Is it worth it to get the spectral cf 7 over the al 6?
MTB,fzjluz,Buying new bike to swap parts.,"Hello all. I have a Canyon Neuron AL 7. It's my first mountain bike after years of road and fat biking (live in Alaska where there's snow on the ground 7 months a year) and I really like it. It's light, nimble and has a good amount of travel for trails around my area. 

When I was buying it the canyon size calculator put me on large bordering on XL. Now I'm 6'2"" with a 36"" inseam. Every bike I've ever owned has been XL. Still after calling canyon and verifying I ordered the large.

I can't help the feeling that the bike is just a bit small for me. Particularly because the neuron isn't very progressive geo to begin with, it has 455/475 reach on the large and XL. It always feels like I'm riding ontop of the bike with not a lot of room to move around and not very stable. I keep wondering what the XL would feel like with taller headtube and and almost an inch longer reach. 

Now I noticed I can get the Neuron AL 6.0 (significantly worse specs) in XL for $1500 currently. I am considering doing this then swapping all the parts over from my current frame, I could then put all those lower end parts on my current frame and sell the resulting bike which would be a large frame with SRAM NX and rockshox suspension. There aren't many options for full suspension bikes in the shops near me so I'm pretty sure I could break even doing this. I've looked into buying a frame alone and haven't seen too many affordable options. Plus I don't think I could sell my frame by itself.

Has anyone ever done anything like this? Only issue I can think of is the steer tube on my current fork (fox 34) possibly being too short for the new frame."

The AF us definitely the better value and I love the lines of both the bikes.

I don't have a bike computer now, but the most important thing that I think I need are:

* long battery life
* good and clear screen in strong sun and shady forest
* STABILITY and long-term support
* not interested in trainings and such
* able to collect and view tracks I've recorded. No need for Strava and such, I want to have them in my app/computer.

•My budget is roughly $1200-2200 max. 
•I would like to get a full suspension bike
•I will be doing a decent amount of climbing (but nothing too extreme like XC) so I’m looking at trail and enduro/all mountain bikes. 
•don’t necessarily have a preference on 27.5 vs 29. Never ridden a mullet so can’t comment on that. 
• I would prefer to have a drop post already on the model so that I won’t have to upgrade it after purchasing. 
•I was looking at alchemy arktos, but unfortunately the 2019 model I had been looking at has been sold and I’m hesitant to save up and fork out 4000$ on the 2020 model. 
• lots of my local shops carry Cannondale, Rocky Mountain, and GT pretty exclusively relative to other companies. Any comments/recommendations on these bikes from your own personal use? Should I sway towards other options, etc.?

There's 3-4 duplicates of that seal in the factory kit, and they're all about 0.5mm too small in diameter.  When I put the seal in the channel, it flops out, so only one side will be in, and one side hangs out.  FWIW, the original seal I saw when I first opened the shock also exhibited this behavior.  


When inserting that last seal... is it supposed to ""lock in"" to the channel?  I think I'm missing something here...

MTB,fyg6x6,Chainring advice. 28T to 36T?,"I have a 2017 Diamondback Mason that I use for everything, including 20mi road rides. On those longer road rides the bike is just too spinny with the stock 28T chainring. Id like to up it to either a 34T or 36T. Im in SE Michigan and there arn't many insanely long climbs on the trails, so I dont think Ill miss the lower gear loss. Id much rather not be spinning at 100 on on the road rides (probably more than 50% of my rides recently.) 

I do have a few questions that I cant get answered locally because all the bike shops are closed. Do I need to buy a ""off-set"" chainring for my bike? Also, will I need to lengthen my chain with the jump in chainring size?

MTB,fycqq9,Jumping.,"Hi guys,

So my mate and i went riding this afternoon and it was awesome! He got his first bike in 4 years, and he was straight back into the groove of it. The one thing he excels at that i don't is jumping. He filmed me jumping and i always seem to push down instead of 'pulling up' off the lip. I asked how he does it and he said he can't explain it and just goes with the flow.

&amp;#x200B;

I know people can't just tell me what to do and it'll fix me but what are some tips you guys can offer? I'll even send the video to someone personally if they're that interested. But i always always have seemed to just push down, it's very odd. I have tried 'pulling up' but feel a bit out of control and off centred in a way. I appreciate all advice. Thanks guys!"

MTB,fybejw,Drivetrain Upgrade Advice,"Hey all. Looking to upgrade my drivetrain, looking around at options.

I have a Kona Big Honzo DL, with a SRAM NX 11-42 setup. I mostly ride in western Washington and BC, and do a combination of trail riding and long-distance bike packing.

I was originally leaning towards a 10-50 X01 Eagle cassette, shifters, and RD, and GX Eagle cranks because I don't want or need carbon fiber. Mostly looked at this because SRAM was what was already on the bike

I'm now considering Shimano's 10-51 XT M8100 set up because it seems to be getting good reviews, and is significantly cheaper than SRAM. I'm also a much bigger fan of Shimano's shifting triggers.

Anyone run either of these drivetrains? What do you like/not like about it?

I am currently using an MTB for exercising(everyday for about 10 miles) and probably learning some tricks like bunny hops, wheelies,  stoppies and those kind of simple tricks. Second thing, there are no tracks or trails in my state. So I'm never gonna bring it to a track cause there's none. 
 
1. My bike is old and uses rim brakes. I'm a student, so i don't really have a lot of money. Should I change to disc brakes? 

2. My fork is rusted. Should I buy new ones or just try to unrust it? 

3. I want to change my handlebar because the width size is just too small. If I buy another handlebar is it easy to install(just remove brakes and shifters and install it on new bar)?"

MTB,fy618o,PSI and Fork Sag Problem,"2013? Rockshox Revelation Dual Position 140mm.

I'm about 185lb aiming for 20% sag.

According to the chart on the fork:

180-200lb = 140-155 psi
200-220lb = 155-170 psi
220lb+ = 170psi+
Max PSI is 255

Setting to 155 psi gives me 30% sag even though that PSI should give correct sag for someone 15lb heavier.

Setting to 180 PSI which is literally off the charts gives me 25%..

To get 20% sag, I need it at around 200 PSI, which while below the mechanical limits of the fork, feels pretty stiff. It's hard to push down while standing on ground (I'm pretty strong).

Is this normal? I know there's going to be some variance based on frame geometry, but this seems extreme. I followed different methods of instructions across youtube and google and it was all pretty consistent. What could be the issue?"

MTB,fxxzq2,Need Some Advice / Opinions on Components for 1st MTB,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

Posted to r/whichbike recently and got some great [feedback based on my application](https://www.reddit.com/r/whichbike/comments/fpys9a/help_me_choose_a_mtb_surly_trek_bmc_raleigh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) (TLDR: experienced on 2 wheels, getting into MTB for the 1st time, also riding around town w/toddler seat so **rack mount points required**), and looked into the stickied buying guide and new rider posts. I've been checking pinkbike, Craigs, &amp; FB with no luck the last couple weeks, so I'm ready to buy new. I'm between a couple different bikes in the $500-$800 range, but not sure if the step-up in price is worth it:

&amp;#x200B;

The [REI Co-op DRT 1.2](https://www.rei.com/product/106336/co-op-cycles-drt-12-bike#product-reviews) for $583 vs. the [Marin Bobcat Trail 5](https://www.marinbikes.com/bikes/20-bobcat-trail-5) at \~$850.

&amp;#x200B;

The REI comes with:

9x3 Deore Shadow setup

27.5"" wheels

120mm SR Suntour XCR forks (and boost axles, I believe? they're 15mm on the front, at least)

&amp;#x200B;

So, not a bad bike. Prefer a 29er and not a fan of the 3X setup, but I can deal with it until I decide to swap. The thing haunting me is that with the Marin, for the extra \~$200, I get:

Deore Shadow ""Plus"" (?) 1X11 drivetrain

tubeless compatible 29"" rims

larger/better brakes

but, same 120mm Suntour XCR air forks

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know enough about bottom bracket construction or finer handlebar details to decipher much more, but the rest seems comparable. Also not sure what Marin resale value looks like since there seem to be few on the market, but people seem to like the REI bikes for the value/$.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is the Marin worth it?**

&amp;#x200B;

Gives a little more room to grow into it without being a stupidly-expensive first bike, but the REI bike seems like a great deal. I'll also take any other recommendations if you have 'em. :) (Giant Talon 2/3, Haro Flightline were also on the list; the Nishiki Colorado Comp was also until I found out how much their prices have increased)."

MTB,fxwvyu,Scott Ransom 930 vs 920 Components,"I'm considering buying a new bike this spring. I get a bit of a discount on the Ransom through work which is why it's top of my list right now.

I ride trail almost every day, bike park once a week and shuttle days/weekends around once a month so I think I'd like something more enduro than trail. When I got my current bike (2016 Rocky Mountain Altitude) I got the base component spec/carbon frame on sale. After a while (and 2 rebuilds on the Manitou fork, luckily under warranty) I thought if I were doing it again I'd prefer better components on an alloy frame vs base components on carbon if the prices were the same.

I'm just wondering if I should stick to my guns or if the components on the 930 are good enough. Are the base spec components of today better than the 2nd level components of 4 years ago?

Quick Summary:

 | 930 | 920
---|---|----
**Fork** | RockShox Yari RL Solo Air | FOX 36 Float Performance Air
**Shock** | X-Fusion NUDE Trunnion | FOX NUDE T EVOL Trunnion
**Drivetrain** | SX Eagle 12spd | NX Eagle 12spd
**Brakes**| MT420 | MT520

The 920 is quite a bit more expensive (about $700 Canadian) and at that price point other bikes start to come into play for a little more (YT Capra/Jeffsy, 2019 Commencal Meta AM 29 Essential Fox, Transition Sentinel). And then there are way too many components to wrap my tiny brain around.

Finding reviews for the bikes in general is fairly easy but they're rarely focused on the lower component builds so it's hard to know what you're really getting into sometimes."

MTB,fxtled,Help requested: Manitou Mezzer Pro 160mm vs Lyrik Ultimate Charger 2.1 RC2 150mm,"Hi everyone!

I am currently building my new enduro/trail 29"" bike, and choosing between two forks:

1. Manitou Mezzer Pro 160mm 
2. RockShox Lyrik Ultimate Charger 2.1 RC2 150mm

There are a few cons and pros for both of them 

**RockShox Lyrik Ultimate pros**:

* very popular, many people choose it
* it is easy to find service kits
* good result as per tests
* 150mm is a maximum recommended fork for my frame, so i follow recommendation of frame manufacturer

**Manitou Mezzer Pro pros**:

* reverse arch (protect legs from dirt, less weight, etc.)
* good weight for a 180mm fork
* easy to change travel (i have plans to change frame in 1-2 years so will change travel back to 180mm)
* stanchions 37mm

**Manitou Mezzer Pro cons**:

* not popular, so there is not so easy to find service kits in local store
* no official service in my country
* 160mm has 30mm bigger crown to axle distance than my frame is recommended

&amp;#x200B;

Never ridden any of them, because it is difficult to find them in local store, so this is blind choice. Many people recommend me to choose Manitou because they are technically better. But also there are a lot of riders who have chosen Lyrik for some reason. 

If this is important: 

* Weight: 191 lbs (88 kg)
* Style: Enduro/Trail

MTB,fxoz3c,Best MTB clipless shoes?,"Hello,

As trends changes, I'm pretty far away from keeping up with them. I still ride 3x9 MTB with full lycra and clipless MTB shoes, you know like a serious racer. lol

Anyways, trends started to change and I'm considering buying normal loose shorts for my MTB. With that I remember that I saw Shimano clipless shoes back in the day, but the catch was that they looked more like a trekking shoe, instead of stiff MTB carbon shoe.

It's not usual that I wander around trails on my feet, but from time to time I geocache in the wild with friends, which requires getting off the bike and walking around.

I think I seen some Shimano clipless shoes with the ability to close that part (not screw it in with screws) where the cleats are attached (I forgot how that thing is called) or my memory is lying to me? Does anything like this exists?

In conclusion, I'm looking for versatile MTB shoes. Any recommendations?"
MTB,fxovig,New to biking: question torque wrench -&gt; cassette,"Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty new to the sport (started last year in august) and like learning/doing all maintenance stuff on my bike myself. Recently I have busted up my cheap rims and they now have some small cracks. Therefore I bought a new wheelset with XT hubs. Now I am looking in buying the tools to switch my cassette to my new wheels. My google search has learned me so far that I want to put on the cassette with 40Nm. Unfortunately due to the coronacrisis we are a bit more pickey on where we spend our money (I live in the Netherlands, border belgium and my wife had to close her company). And I have a small tool for lower torque Nm's which came with my bike but I do not have the torque wrench that goes to 40Nm. They are also pretty expensive over here. I do have the option to borrow a chain whip and cassette removal tool with lever but no torque. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it essential that I do this job with a torque wrench? Or will a good tight with the cassette tool will be sufficient? How is your experience in this? It would be a bummer to buy a tool around 100 euros which I will not use, only for my cassette.

MTB,fxmvtx,Greasin bolts.,"Quick question, new to MTB from BMX and I just picked up a bike that was sat in a house for a year probably.

I wanna grease the bolts but I'm not sure if there are extra cautions to consider. What to grease, what not to grease. What to crank down very tight. What to not over tighten.

The major issue is the pivot bolts, as so much stress gets put on em. Should i be greasin and crankin these things down or is there some nuance to avoid blowing out the bushings/bearings/whatever.

New to the suspension/derailleur/brakes game. Thanks."
MTB,fxkb13,Question about 1x drivetrain,"I’m supposed to be picking up my new bike tomorrow afternoon (women’s Roscoe 6) and tonight I have been reading a lot about the 1x drivetrain it has.

A lot of what I’ve read is that 1x systems suck for climbs due to the lack of range in the gears. I am a very new rider (1 year) and I tire pretty easily on significant climbs. I live in Michigan so the trails here are obviously not legit mountains, but there can be some climbs that I personally consider to be pretty tough. I usually have my bike in the lowest possible gear when I’m trying to get up the steepest hills. Am I going to be ok with a 1x system? My bike now has a 3x but I find myself almost never using the highest gears."

MTB,fxjidn,Fox fork and shock refresh/rebuild advice,"I have a 2013 Giant trance with a Fox 32 CTD float Evolution fork and a float shock.  Bought the bike second hand in 2015 and to the best of my knowledge neither the fork nor shock had been serviced.  I've been riding more lately, and thinking it would be wise to refresh things.  

After doing some initial research, it seem at min I should and plan to change the bath fluid (Fox gold 20wt) in the fork and replace the sanction dust seals.  I was also planning on cleaning out the shock and putting in some new float fluid.  Is this sufficient?  

Is it worth going an extra step and replacing all the seals on the shock and the air spring if they aren't leaking?  If that is a must, should I also change the Fox red 10wt in the cartridge damper as well?

I plan to do all the work myself as it looks pretty straight forward. Thanks!"

Thought about a garage gym, but most things I would buy are out of stock with no ETA and the thought of a garage gym in the midwest winter in a unheated garage doesn't seem like a good time.  Then thought, next best thing would to be up my cardio game and get a bike.  

I ordered a Specialized Rockhopper Sport last night for what I think was a good price - $500 for a $710 MSRP bike seemed like a good deal ([https://www.specialized.com/us/en/mens-rockhopper-sport/p/129117?color=240213-129117&amp;searchText=81218-7102](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/mens-rockhopper-sport/p/129117?color=240213-129117&amp;searchText=81218-7102)) but having some second thoughts.

I like the idea of a 1x drivetrain, as its less things to do/worry about while riding and maintaining... after reading more here (shouldn't really worry about upgrading entry level bikes) and looking at parts to upgrade the 3x8 to a 1x9-12 (ouch)... I'm thinking I should probably just buy a different bike.

What I will be doing with it is mostly just paved trails by my house, but I want something more than just a leisure road bike since I would want take it camping/down to the lake during the summers, which is mostly dirt/gravel roads.  I like the idea of a $500 bike, as it doesn't hurt the wallet too much, but I'm thankful to have a job that allows me to WFH during these times... so biting the bullet and getting something more of what I want isn't totally out of my budget.

I've looked at used bikes, but nothing around my area has caught my eye, as they're either really old rusted out bikes or expensive road bikes hence why I decided to go new - and I need something with an XL frame being 6'3"" which also dwindles away my used options.

Anyways.  Am I overthinking this?  Even after this whole situation winds down I will definitely still use the bike, as I despise running and enjoy biking a whole lot more for the sake of cardio (or at least used to, been about a decade since I last owned a bike - which was a $150 walmart bike).

MTB,fxd6jo,Critique my 1x11 upgrade list,"Hey /r/mtb, I currently ride a 2015 Rocky Mountain Altitude 750, and am looking at finally upgrading the 2x10 drivetrain, having added a dropper last year. 

Here are the specs of the bike:
https://www.bikes.com/en/bikes/altitude/2015

As far as the upgrade goes, I'm looking at the following list of parts:

* Cassette: Sunrace MX80 11-46 (more gradual steps than the Shimano)

* Shifter: Shimano XT SL-M8000
* Chainring: Raceface narrowwide 32T 104BCR
* Rear derailleur: Shimano XT RD-M8000 SGS
* Bashguard: Oneup ISCG05 V2
* Extra: Wolftooth GOATlink 11spd

I suppose my questions are the following:

1) Anything you'd change?

Specifically:

2) Sunrace vs Shimano 11-46 cassette

3) 32T chainring a good middle ground, or should I be thinking 30 or 34?

4) Even with the extra length of the SGS derailleur arm, is the GOATlink still a necessity to avoid excessive B-screw use?

5) Anyone used the Oneup bashguard on an Altitude from this era? Worried about frame compatibility.

Thanks!

EDIT: And a chain too. I just don't really count that as an upgrade."

MTB,fxaaim,Is a Giant Anthem Advanced 29 1 too short-travel to be a versatile trail bike?,"So long story short a local bike shop has a Giant Anthem Advanced 29 1 for sale. It's a new 2018 model they're having trouble getting rid of. They are selling it cheap and including a dropper post. 

I couldn't test ride it on a trail but I took it through a bumpy dirt lot and over some curbs and it felt relatively squishy for a short-travel XC bike. Also the idea of a bike with a carbon frame and carbon wheels for around $2,600 is really appealing. However, I'm worried that the short travel will limit me (it only has 100mm of travel in the front and 90mm in the rear). I mostly ride flow but I still hit some tech-y shit from time to time. 

Even though it's aluminum there is another shop selling last year's Scott Spark 950 and that seems like it would be better for what I ride (120mm travel front and back). It's a bit cheaper as well. But I'm scared that if I pass on something full-carbon this cheap I will regret it. 

Can someone give me some advice? Should I get a nice carbon XC-oriented bike and deal with roughness on more technical shit, or get a more well-rounded aluminum trail bike?"
MTB,fxa6wo,How would you build it? – 2020 Specialized Epic Hardtail,"I am building up a 29er hardtail for a mix of MTB trails, XC exploring and gravel rides, primarily in the Central Oregon area.

Through a trade, I'm going to have a bare carbon frame. Being new to the MTB scene from road I am trying to figure out exactly what group, wheels and fork I want to build this up with in line with my goals: \~$1,700 budget for build, keep it light, 1x for simplicity.

MTB,fx8kvk,Saddle Rubbing Thigh due to new Dropper and Seat Clamp Offset,"I recently upgraded my dropper post from a KS DropZone to a KS Lev Integra, and have noticed that the saddle is now rubbing my thigh when in a downhill attack position whereas it had never done this before. I have tried moving my saddle with the new Integra dropper pushed all the way forward, all the way back, and in the middle, with no success. In comparing the differences between the two, the seat clamp offset is a difference of about 20mm, which is quite a lot when accounting for body position and the thigh gap on the saddle.

In the photo, you can see to the left is how my saddle sat with the old dropper. The saddle bar basically ends at the start of the seat tube due to the 20mm offset, whereas how the bar goes well beyond the seat tube. This results in my saddle not being as far back as I expect it to be, and causes that thigh rubbing. 

I am currently running a 270mm x 140mm saddle, but also tried a WTB Silverado 280mm x 142mm saddle, and both give the same problem.

Are there saddles I can buy that naturally seat further back? Should I switch to a longer saddle to bring the back of it further back? Should I switch to a narrow saddle width to bring the saddle a little bit more inward, away from my thighs? Am confused as to what I should try, and would appreciate some ideas!"

MTB,fx74uj,Another new bike advice post - Cujo 2 vs Roscoe 6 vs X-Caliber 8," So I've read through a ton of ""choose my bike"" posts but in the middle of what's going on in the world I felt this was worth the big caveat of:  For multiple reasons, the primary being corona, I am not going to be able to go to multiple bike shops and try out all the different options.  I need to pick a bike, go to the shop, get the size right, and take it home so long as it doesn't feel awful.

I'm going to be riding mostly on a beginner single track, but want to get enough bike that I can graduate to other stuff in the area (in West Chester, NY) without having to upgrade.  After doing all the research I can and calling around to a bunch of different stores, I'm settled on spending around $1000, hopefully less, and the following three options, all 2019 models:

Cannondale Cujo 2 - $1000
Trek Roscoe 6 - $860
Trek X-Caliber 9 - $950

From what I can see, the Cujo has better components, plus I get the dropper seat which seems to be a big deal for a lot of people, so I'm leaning in that direction now.

 'Enjoy' is probably the wrong term, more like, I get some kinda masochistic joy out of it? 

When it's just you, your bike and the mild, ever present, dull burning in your legs. When you find that energy-preserving line. When you find the perfect gear and cadence. And when you finally make it to the top, and only kinda died once halfway through, as opposed to three times like that time two weeks ago. That's the kinda shit that brings me out of the house and onto the bike!

I ran these for probably close to a year on a DH bike. I never had issues with it. I have been doing tubes for the last few years cause I am really lazy. But I was recently talking about going back to tubeless and happened to mention the use of Gorilla tape for rim tape to a few friends, some of who are bike shop dudes (meaning these fools work in bike shops and assume they have all the info) that said some crazy shit about the sealant having a reaction to the actual tape and causing issues. I guess my question is did anyone else use Gorilla tape or some sort of duct tape to seal rims and have or have not had issues? I just dont feel like I have enough experience from my one time use that I could say its totally fine. I guess I am just asking for a friend."

MTB,fw8r0r,New Wheelset Help!," Hey All,

So I'm building up a bike but can't decide on which wheelset to buy.  
These are my options:

1. Crankbrothers Synthesis E 11 w/ P321 Hubs (2.5º Quiet Engagement / x6 Magnetic Pawls)  
2. Crankbrothers Synthesis E w/ Crankbrothers House Hubs (17º Engagement / x6 Pawls)  
3. Hunt All Mountain Carbon H\_Impact w/ Hunt House Hubs (3º Engagement / x6 Pawls)

First off, are P321 Hubs any good? I've been looking at reviews but some are from a while back and they talk about them slipping sometimes? Would it be better to get the cheaper version and then upgrade to Onyx hubs from the house hubs later on (1-2 years?)

Never heard of Hunt Wheels before but lots of reviews of their alloy wheels being really good.

All opinions are welcome please. This is the last piece of the bike I'm buying. Also, I'm welcome to other wheel options/hubs."
MTB,fw824m,Fixing Broken Rebound on Fox 32 Talas (2012)?,"**I am new to working on bikes.** I (semi successfully) replaced the shock fluid in my 2012 fox 32 talas forks last weekend. Semi successfully because the new fluid and seals part went fine...

On the trail yesterday the rebound felt off. When I tried to adjust it (red aluminum dial on top of the fork) I noticed I couldn't find its endpoint/s. AKA the rebound dial just kept spinning (both ways), I can't seem to find its min or max point/s.

I took the red cap off when I got home and found the screw inside that the red knob essentially turns. I turned that to do some more testing and the same thing happened. It just keeps spinning and I can't find a min or max point. 

I DID NOT take the inner components outside of the uppers (sorry for lack of technical terms) when I replaced the fluid. The lowers came off, that was it. I didn't (intentionally) make any rebound adjustments or mess with any of the parts affecting same when I replaced the fluid. Although, obviously I did something I shouldn't have. 

I would normally take it to a shop (as I likely would have for the fluid change to begin with) but I couldn't wait during the time they needed to do it (COVID and all). Plan is to bring it there when I can but wanted to post here in the meantime...

Any insight would be appreciated."

MTB,fw41ba,"A few questions about 27.5""+ and the tires that love them.","So I purchased a new Cannondale Cujo 1, my first mountain bike since I was a kid of 14 years old. A lot has changed in the last 15 years and I have been a road cyclist since then, so current tire sizes are quite alien to me.

The Cujo comes with WTB STX i35 TCS rims, and Maxxis Rekon tires that are 2.8"" wide. For the type of riding I have access to and the type of riding I plan to do, I think this might be a little bit much for me. I didn't really enjoy many of the 29"" bikes I tried, as they mostly felt a little pillowy and bouncy. The 27.5"" wheel is size I am much more comfortable with, however the Rekon's might be a little too pillowy in the same way.

My first swap out on this bike, I'd like to be the tires, to something 2.6"" or even 2.4"" wide, maybe in skinwall for a little extra spice ;).

So ultimately my question is, how am I able to identify which tires will sit correctly in my rims? Will 2.6 be too narrow? Will 2.4?

I am aware that with the lower size and the difference in pressure, I am aware the BB height will drop a little bit, but I can't imagine so much that riding fairly basic trails will affect me negatively.

Anyways, any insight that can be offered is more than appreciated."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to build a bike and I have a current-gen XT/SLX groupset on order (SLX: rear derailleur and cassette. XT: shifter and chain).

I have a cheap, chinese 104BCD crankset, so I was thinking about slapping that crankset onto my build for now.

But, from what I've read, Shimano's new 12 speed chain is slightly narrow for the ""narrow-wide"" spec. Meaning that chains don't really fit. As a result, I might skip trying save some money for now and just buy a SLX (M7100) crank.

MTB,fvlrsm,Budget Full Suspension MTB Build,"Hello all! I've been looking at getting a full suspension MTB for awhile now and after a very large amount of research (literally months), I've settled on the Marin Rift Zone 1 (with some tweaks) and I wanted to know what you guys thought. 

I am taking a different approach to a budget MTB. I've been looking for a really modern frame that will grow with me over time and I've been looking to ""Min-Max"" my MTB as much as possible. What I mean by ""Min-Max"" is to spend money on things I intend on keeping for a long time (frame, suspension, dropper) while spending as little as possible on parts that will be replaced when they wear out (drivetrain, brakes, etc). This idea can be seen in this article: 

https://nsmb.com/articles/min-maxing-budget-bikes-marin/

I've looked at basically every MTB I can in the budget category and I think the rift zone makes the most sense for the approach I am trying. 

So with all of that in mind, I hit up the wonderful guys at Jenson for a build and this is what I am looking at so far:

- Marin Rift Zone 1 XL
- OneUp Dropper 180mm
- OneUp Dropper Remote lever
- OneUp composite Pedals
- Marzocchi Bomber z2 fork (130mm, 44mm offset, 29)

OTD: 2,000$

I think I like this build more than the rift zone 2 because I'm not spending money on a drivetrain I'm gonna upgrade down the road, and I get a much better fork and dropper for the money. I have also considered going straight to a pike or fox 34/36 on the front. 

Aditionally, I plan on upgrading to an SLX groupset (drivetrain, crankset, brakes, etc) so it makes little sense to spend extra on that now when I can get that down the road after the deore wears out. 

What do you guys think? Should I just stick to the base Rift Zone 1 and upgrade everything as it wears out or should I spend more on suspension now, knowing that it costs more to replace those down the road?"

[Brakes](http://imgur.com/a/CmWAYZA)

1. Does anybody have any tips or pointers or is it as easy as unclipping the old pads and clipping in new ones?

2. Will [these](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5063-869/B01S-Resin-Disc-Brake-Pads) pads fit? I feel like they will but I can't find anything that says they're exactly compatiable with the Radius BH M760"
MTB,fvb1h9,B tension troubles,"Hi Redditors!

I own a 2019 canyon Strive which came mounted with a 11 speed XT casette. I am now converting the bike to NX eagle 11-50 because i am not a great climber and need the extra teeth. 

Now, all was going well until it came to dailing in the derailleur. The top jockeywheel of the derailleur is hitting the casette. Normally i'd fix this by adjusting the b-tension but thats where the problem starts. The b-tension adjustment screw is not hitting the limiter of the derailleur pad. Now i am thinking either: 

1. The adjustment screw is too short. 
2. The derailleurpad is not suitable for SRAM eagle and should be replaced. However on Canyons website i can't find another type of pad. 
3. I am doing something else wrong. 

Anybody got experience with a issue like this or a good idea? i am kinda stuck here!

Thanks!"

MTB,fv7bxo,Does your bike have a hole in the bottom bracket shell to drain water?,"Replaced a dead BB on a 2016 Specialized Fuse today and noticed a ton of moisture in the shell. Crank spindle was rusted to the bearing. Looks like the seat tube has the dropper cable hole right in front of the back wheel and it drains into the BB shell.

Have definitely outgrown the hard tail lifestyle (although not going to be abandoning it). I have finally decided to look into getting something that can handle some enduro while staying in the realm of a shredder trail bike.

MTB,fv5kah,2016 Scott Spark 920 questions,"Hello

I’m looking at a used Scott Spark 920. It looks like a killer bike for the price, especially on the used market. But I have some questions. 

1. Is there enough room on the inside of the frame for a dropper post? I’d assume so but I’d like to double check. 

2. How does it feel compared to the recent updated ones? I’ve test rode a recent one that has a different frame shape and shock position, but I haven’t rode this year before. 

The bike is a couple hours away so I’d like to know this before I go check it out."
MTB,fv4vfv,semi new rider,"hope everyone is doing well during this quarantine,
im a fairly new mountain biker, i can ride most blue trails at my local park without problem if they dont involve jumps, but drop offs and most technical stuff i can get by with little to know problems. my problem is that i think my bike is too slack to both manual and  bunny hop. during this quarantine, ive been riding street in my backyard and around my house, and no matter what i do, i can get the front end of my bike higher than a couple inches of the ground when i try to manual. now, ive watched tutorials and im pretty sure i have the technique down, but my bike refuses to get up. I've noticed that the balance point is unusually high, and that has been confirmed by several of my friends attempting to wheely. ive been using my hips instead of my arms to try to pull the front up, but like i said before, its just not working.
i ride a hard tail (a 2017 Raleigh tokul 2, less than 30 pounds, im 16 and 155ish pouns for some background) and i bought it 2 years ago since it was advertised as a trail/enduro bike. now, this bike has it's benefits during downhill runs as it doesnt slip down from under me, but at the same time, its too hard to get the front wheel up if theres a quick transition into a drop off.
any tips on how to manual better/get more comfortable on my bike?
im trying to take advantage of my new freetime during quarentine."

MTB,fv2qfw,What are the items you take with you every ride?,Just getting into biking and am curious what everyone has in their pack or wherever.
MTB,fv1hfc,COVID-19 precautions,"As someone who loves and misses being able to go riding as many of our local trails are closed and we’re under quarantine, I can’t help but cringe when I still see videos of crashes or risky tricks. 

Hospitals are either near max capacity due to the pandemic or above it. It means that if any of us get hurt we may not be able to get care and if we are lucky enough to find a hospital bed it would mean a bed not available for someone who may be dying from COVID related causes. 

This is not a great time to be taking unnecessary risks that could require hospital care. Especially because it could mean contracting COVID by needing care at the hospital and tracking it back into your household and others. 

This pandemic will not last forever and in the meantime we should all focus on staying out of the hospital and give it at least a few months before sending it big!

Be well and stay safe."
MTB,fv1dbb,Dropper post Lever wont depress unless Weight is off seat...,"Hi, I just installed a PNW Bachelor on my wife's bike.    


Well, mostly.  It looks great, the lever springs the seat back, and down, etc.  BUT if your butt is on the seat, the lever is super hard to depress.  If you stand in the saddle, and get the weight off the seat, the lever is easy, and it goes right down, and the seat is adjustable.  I can not figure out what to adjust, and googling has not helped with this issue.  Any tips?  

&amp;#x200B;

The lever i have is an old one with no brand.  it has a screw to tighten the cable on the lever.  It ""nut"" end of the cable attaches to the post.  


Thanks in advance!"
MTB,fv12my,Do my brakes need bleeding?,"I bought a new Kona process 6 months ago. It was. 2017 model that he shop built up for me.

MTB,fv10wj,Rear derailleur replacement question,"Hey guys, so I've been having issues with my rear derailleur recently. I can't get into 2nd gear, 1 and 3-9 are fine. No matter how much i adjust the thing I cant get it to grab second. I think it may be bent a bit. The part is a Shimano Alivio RDM430 (https://www.amazon.com/Shimano-Alivio-RD-M430-Speed-Derailleur/dp/B07CMYNXPV). It seems to be an old product replaced by the RDM4000 (https://www.amazon.com/SHIMANO-ALIVIO-RD-M4000-Derailleur-Triple/dp/B010CEBAI4).

Should I use the old one or would the newer one serve me better? I'm not even sure if it'll swap right on. Not sure if anyone knows the answer but I figured I'd try.  Thanks in advance!!"
MTB,fuzxes,Ordering a bike online during quarantine.,"I posted here for the first time the other day concerning brands. My gf and I want to order bikes. I'm a previous mt. biker (like 10 yrs ago, I'm in my 30s now), she is not. During this COVID situation, obviously we can't just go to a shop and test ride bikes. Is this a bad call ordering online without testing any out first? I noticed Trek is doing something with sending bikes to your door because of this situation, and offering 30 day returns. And then I learned the other day there are ""direct to customer"" I believe they're called companies that do this. I've been leaning toward Trek or Specialized, 2 models in particular, but that will be my next question I ask I guess haha.

MTB,funpzs,Help!...2015 Santa Cruz Bronson or 2016 Scott Genius 710?,"Hi,

I need help deciding on my next bike. I have a 2014 carbon Norco Sight, but I want a backup bike and a bike that I can bring friends along to ride with who aren't entirely invested in the sport enough to get their own. It's worth it to me to have a loaner to have company on my trail rides for whichever friend is available for that day.

On my local Craigslist section, I found both a 2016 Scott genius carbon for $2100 as well as a 2015 Santa Cruz Bronson carbon for $1900...both with some typical minor upgrades.

Let's assume that I can whittle the Scott Genius down to $1900. Which one do you recommend and why? I like the look of the green and black Scott genius better, but from what I read, people seem to think the Santa Cruz has a better value for the money?

I will mostly be riding intermediate trails, but I want something that will handle an aggressive bike park if we choose to take a trip to a resort. I think the Scott Genius has more travel maybe?

And should I make either of these bikes my main bike over my 2014 Norco sight?

Thanks"
MTB,fumdto,Salsa timberjack slx 29 vs timberjack deore 29.,"Hi, I need help deciding my first mountain bike. I have to go through several posts here and they are extremely helpful. However, I have a couple of things I want to check with you all before I put a hole in the pocket. I have decided to go with the Salsa brand and Timberjack model. Now, one of the most popular models I see people talk about here is the 'timberjack slx 29'. So I started to see the specs on this bike and compared that to some recommendations made in the mtb buying guide on this subreddit. Specifically talking about forks, the guide says  "" **Air fork:** The cheapest fork I'd safely recommend is the SR Suntour XCR Air fork. Anything less than that from SR Suntour or RST is pretty much a pogo stick with poor damping and limited adjustability. The low-end RockShox coils aren’t terrible, but I'd shoot for air. Forks can be upgraded down the road, but are often the single most expensive component on the bike. "" But when you see the most recommended ""timberjack slx 29"", it seems to not have this kind of air fork. I wouldn't be too worried about it if it did not say that upgrading to air forks can be expensive. The slx also comes with a dropper seat post that I see a lot of people recommend. So that's a plus.

[SLX](https://preview.redd.it/bzgkz8wfxpq41.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc7dad95789d2d699348685ed28d25c589ebb390)

I started looking at different models in the Salsa brand and found 'timberjack deore 29' which is $300 cheaper and comes with the buying guide recommended fork ' SR Suntour XCR 34 Air LOR 130mm' and also the dropper seat post. 

[Deore](https://preview.redd.it/3959i9wfxpq41.png?width=1187&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41ff1eb2138a95cb1d4b62ead6ecc31896ee629b)

I went on my first ride of the season today, and over nine miles I had to stop and raise my seat again 3-4 times. I've tightened the screw to the point that I can barely close the clamp and have to hammer it closed with my palm towards the end....but the seat ends up creeping down and bottoming out eventually anyway. I've got iffy knees to begin with, and I think some of the issues I was feeling late last year are related to this.

MTB,fuhfbz,Drivetrain Question,"
Background: Hello Redditers I recently picked up a new bike (Yeti SB95) and I have noticed that some of the gears skip when under tension. The previous owner put a 1x12 SRAM GX Eagle on it, but after my first ride I noticed it’s pretty beat and I’m thinking that’s why the skipping is occurring. The derailleur seems to be straight. 

Question: Can I replace the cassette with another brand that is cheaper and a 12 speed or does it have to be the Sram GX Eagle?

Side note: I am absolutely in love with this bike and if you’re thinking about getting one do it."

MTB,fuevqo,Trek Fuel Ex8 27.5 rivals or alternatives?,"I am thinking about a new ride this year.

I have a Trek fuel ex 8 27.5, 2014 I think. I really love it.  It's versatile and customized fairly well for me and been reliable which are all very important to me - but mostly it also fits me like a war-worn pony. Bikes are like ski boots - the older I get the more I realize that fit is more important than most specs.

But I am  just a little sick of what I see as Trek's disrespectful trend towards proprietary enslavement, maintenance and customization hassles.

My bag is lots of long mountainous all-condition rides,  Monarch Pass is pretty heavenly for my soul,  Pretty much anything above the treeline anywhere, a lot of long days that start or end up Puke Hill in Park City, and the obligatory gravel-esque week day roadshoulder dry humps like up to Bettaso or the pothole route to Corona Pass. I have city friends who always feel the vanity need to crowd camp in Moab so I always need to ride a few weekends of that rock hopping tourist shit. My secret stashes are long and remote and generally moderate adventures.

Forgiveness on the technical stuff when it arises is important to my longevity - but I don't pay to ride chairlifts, vein-spike the downhill or otherwise chase the progression fandango. I did the Dew, now I just do the doing. 

Back country Flow state is life - so durable reliability matters. A lot. I hate walking out.

I am small-medium sized 5'7 150-180 depending on where the day takes me and my gear.

Thinking maybe Stumpjumper.  Santa Cruz bikes seem more technical and rad oriented but I like their company.  Hoping to stay under 5k including after I change the tires and saddle and ad mud shields and grips and  pedals and chop up the handlebars and stuff.

I am pretty locked into 27.5 -  ideally plus so I can switch out country mouse and city mouse tires.

MTB,fud4e9,Boost 141 QR hub potential easy solution?,"Has anybody tried the Problem Solvers 6mm boost kit to convert a standard 135 qr hub?
https://problemsolversbike.com/products/brakes/booster_-_k5144

The only potential issue is you'd loose purchase on the disc side due to the nipple of the QR not quite poking far enough through the frame dropout slot, and also the skewer spacer would be loose.

I asked Problem Solvers to make a proper spacer, but haven't heard back yet.

I'm very tempted to throw $20 at it to try though. Have 2 bikes with standard 135, and one with this stupid new boost ""standard"".

On the plus side, Shimano now makes a hub for it, the MT-200-B, but it requires center lock discs, not 6 bolt."

I'm currently looking for a new bike and managed to narrow it down to a Canyon Spectral 6.0 AL or Canyon Strive 5.0 CF.  Both cost 2500 EUR and have similar specs.

Most trails in my area involve repeated up and down climbing and are not too technical but I plan on doing occasional trips to the alps as well.    I'm leaning towards a Spectral as most reviews seem to suggest that the Spectral is easier to handle and overall more fun to drive and I'm not too sure I'll like 29"" wheels, I'm 182cm (6'0ft).

MTB,fu4cfm,Choosing frame bearings,"I have been slowly but steadily upgrading/replacing/servicing parts on my specialized enduro evo 2012 for some time now and after removing the rear shock I decided to inspect the frame bearings that were exposed. They seem to be not in the roughest shape but I feel like replacing them all the same.

I decided to extend my bearing knowledge to maybe make a more informed choice rather than just buying a bearing kit, and once i've wrapped my head around bearing names and nomenclature I have still some questions I can't seem to find any answers to.

Do any of you have thoughts on what quality bearings to use on a frame? Instinctively I looked into some of the best manufacturers out there like NTN, SKF, NSK or FAG, but since it is advised to swap out those bearings regularly due to all the dirt that gets to them it seems that any benefits of the better quality/durability will be negated anyway.

Another dilema I have is that the manual states that some of the bearings should be ""full-complement"" which I found out means that the bearing has no cage and more balls inside supposedly providing better load resisance. The problem is I haven't found any full-complement versions of the models that I need. Are they really that better at load bearing and should I bother looking for those?

Maybe I should just forget it and buy a kit?

If any of you guys could answer my questions and maybe offer some additional advice it would be greatly apreciated."

MTB,fu0yr6,Recommendations for torque wrenches?,"What are you favorite and most practical torque wrenches? Not for crazy high torque applications like cassettes or 57nm cranks, but for general use, 5nm bolts on components, 10nm internal suspension pieces, maybe a 20nm linkage bearing bolt or two

MTB,fu0ism,anyone switch from clipless to flats?,"Hi, I jumped back into mtn biking recently. First 8 rides or so were on flats. Then bought a bike with clipless pedals and have done about 12 rides or so. There's a ton of advantages to the clipless pedals, but for me, the drawbacks are (1) I'm really tentative when the going gets technical and bail out early so I don't feel like I'm getting better and (2) I feel like I'm less inclined to goof around and have fun trying wheelies/manuals. All because I'm worried about getting stuck in the pedals and falling over (it's happened 3 times now).

Do I just need to stick with the clipless for &gt;XX number of rides and it'll feel like 2nd nature in no time, or should I make the jump back to flats? 

thanks much!"
MTB,ftzk72,Did I make a mistake,"Hey all - 

So I live in WI, but plan to move to CO when all this COVID stuff is over.  I'm semi new to MTB, I've been riding a year, and still figuring out what I like.

I had a ~$700 Trek Excalibur 6, but I recently got a stock Ibis Rimo AF.  Its a REALLY cool bike, and I'm obviously way out biked in WI, but I'm wondering if it will be too much for CO?

As I learn how I like to ride... I'm learning I like more ""aggressive XC""  When things get really gnarly and fast... I tend to shy away. 

I'm not really interested in hitting huge jumps/drops, going insanely fast downhill, etc., but that could change.

Stuff that interests me looks like the riding out in Crested Butte, Salida, etc.  These long day huge epics like the Monarch Crest trail.  Would I have been better served with something with less travel and, a bit less burly, and less beefy tires (Maxxis Assegai) 

Some of the downhill stuff may be fun someday... but more just to goof around. Stuff like this the below is my dream bread and butter

https://youtu.be/3wo7OkR9HM0
https://youtu.be/kHIF1ANjpME
https://youtu.be/h-YS2WNTsyw

The more i look at this stuff maybe the Ripmo is the right quiver killer bike to do it all?

I'd also like to possibly do something like the Breck Epic XC race someday.  I don't want to do it at a competitive level, just more to challenge myself."

MTB,ftyrke,SRAM DUB Creak,"Hello All, I apologize in advance for the wall of text.  I'm hoping someone could help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been chasing a creak on my 2018 Spot Mayhem for over 6 months now (probably August 2019), and I'm nearly certain it is coming form the SRAM Dub cranks.  The creak only happens when I'm pedaling and placing a decent amount of force on the cranks (going uphill, accelerating in a low gear or I can recreate it by applying the brakes and slowly pedaling on flat ground).  If I'm not pedaling, there is never a creak.  It's a sharp ""click"" that happens in the 12-3 o'clock position on the right crank, and the 9-12 o'clock position on the left. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-It is present in and out of the saddle, so it's not the saddle or seat post. 

\-I have swapped pedals and the creak is still there.

\-I have swapped in an alternate rear wheel/cassette/axle.

\-I have removed, cleaned and greased the derailleur and hanger.

\-I replaced the bottom bracket, cleaning and greasing the threads.

\-Even though the frame made no noise after releasing all air out of the rear shock and cycling the rear triangle, I removed the rear triangle completely, replaced all pivot bearings, and reinstalled making sure to torque everything to spec.  The creak was still there.

\-I do not ride in rain or overly dusty conditions. (Midwest riding) 

&amp;#x200B;

In early November of 2019, I was able to get rid of the creak temporarily although I'm not exactly sure how.  I removed the cranks, chain ring, spacer and tensioner/lock ring and cleaned everything the best I could, applied grease and put it all back together.  The thing is, that was probably the 3rd or 4th time I had done that, but I was only successful that one time.  I was so frustrated that I just kept doing it over and over.  However the bike only remained creak free for about 3-4 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm not installing something right, even though I've followed the SRAM manuals and youtube videos.  I also am wondering if the main bolt that is permanently installed into the drive side crank is the issue (it seems you need some special 4 prong wrench to get that off).  When inspecting the crank off the bike, there is definitely some grit in that bolt. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

\-Should I put grease between the crank and the chain ring?  Should I grease the threads of the 3 chain ring bolts?

\-Should I put grease on the drive side spacer?

\-Should I put grease on the tensioner ring on the non drive side (on the threads or the face that meets the BB)?

\-How much grease should I be putting on the crank shaft itself?  How much grease should be put on the spindle?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically... am I missing something here in how I am installing this?  As I said, I'm following SRAM instructions.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for reading.  I appreciate it."

Does anyone have a decent source for Alu or Ti M2,M3, etc bolts?

(and please note, many of these are non crucial applications like bottle cage bolts and some are purely for aesthetics where a black bolt would look better on my carbon frame than a dull steel bolt etc)."
MTB,ftvapr,New bike suggestions,It’s been probably 15 years since I’ve pick up a bike. I did bmx racing growing up and had a specialized s works frame that was built out pretty well. Last week I went out and grabbed me and the Mrs some cheap Walmart mountain bikes so we could ride with our kids. She’s happy with hers but mine just isn’t cutting it. It’s just poorly made garbage. So naturally I priced out a s works mountain bike and was blown away with the nearly 9k price tag. I did see they had a few lower end models however I never really got into mountain biking so I’m not to familiar with whats is whats. I’m just looking for something that has that nice fit and finish feel for trail riding. I won’t be doing anything to crazy with it but I’d like to know that if I grew some balls and wanted to go off a rock ledge it could take the abuse. Any suggestions would be great. I’m pretty open with price as I’ve come to realize these bikes aren’t cheap. Thanks in advance.

BUT the Trailmaster is sold out in most shops in europe ATM. So going thru CRC i found the Juniper with the same colours (and I even like the design a bit more tbh), but it's women's specific.

I used to ride Cannondale and I liked and trusted them... back then. Back then, it was all Trek, Specialized, Cannondale, etc. 

Now, wow. There are so many different brand names I have never heard of (like Nukeproof) that seem to be well respected. I was leaving towards getting a Trek or possibly Specialized or Cannondale being that I knew and trusted those brands... Is this a good assumption, or am I behind in the game and I need to broaden my horizons to other, newer brands that are just as good or better?

Just want some opinions from people who are super into this sport now and know what's what with respectable brands. Thanks!"
MTB,ftll4y,New Canyon Neuron 2020 Discussion/Help,"Hello and welcome to my first reddit post. I created this account because I want to talk about the new 2020 canyon neuron that was just released.

MTB,fta1og,I need some help deciding on a new pair of tires.,"So i'm buying a new pair of tires for my mountain bike. It's an older 26er trail bike with 18mm inner width rim on the front and a 20mm inner width rim on back. I currently have 2.35's front and rear, though they seem a little wide for the front. The trails around me tend to be hardpack with some loose over hard and it rarely rains, making mud clearing and wet weather handling properties not much of an issue. I'm newer to mountain biking and I don't ride a lot of really technical stuff, so I'm sort of looking for a fast rolling tire for XC/light trail rides. But at the same time I kind of want to push my limits and ride more technical terrain. I'm currently considering the Maxxis Ardent 2.25 and the Schwalbe Nobby Nic Perfromance 2.35, as I have found good deals on them at Chain Reaction.

Do any of you know if Schaeffer Farms is still open? Or do you know of any other fun trails that are still open? I'm getting tired of riding my same local trail."
MTB,fsos46,REVIEW OF CUBE STING WS 120 EXC,"[https://www.cube.eu/en/2020/bikes/women/fullsuspension/sting-ws/cube-sting-ws-120-exc-turquoisenblack-2020/](https://www.cube.eu/en/2020/bikes/women/fullsuspension/sting-ws/cube-sting-ws-120-exc-turquoisenblack-2020/)

MISCELLANEOUS:

Note that is a women's bike, however there's almost no difference compared to men's bike. I only noticed 3:

1. It has women's seat, though you will not notice any difference when sitting on it.
2. Handlebar is shorter, but still a bit too long. However gladly it's not as massive as the one they put on men's bike.
3. Frame design and size is a bit different. On men's bike I would use 18"" frame, but here 20"" was a fit for me.

Otherwise there’s no difference, and honestly if I didn’t know it was meant for women, I wouldn’t have guessed it.

CONS:

• Way too small crank – only 30T. With 11-50T cassette the perfect crank size would have to be bigger than 40T. With 30T there’s just not enough speeds to go fast even on flat surface, not to mention when you go downhill. On the other side you really will not use 42T and 50T gears, as they are just too light. The other problem is that you cannot put bigger crank than 34T (or maybe 36T), which is a terrible design disaster. However it’s good to point out that other manufacturers of full suspension bikes with no front derailleur have made similar mistakes.

• Useless hydraulic seatpost which can be operated from handlebar. I have no idea why someone would need it, since you adjust the seat only once. Quite possible you will just accidentally pull switch in the middle of riding and drop your seat, so it went straight to the dumpster. It’s also a shame that it costs almost 200€, which makes this bike at least 100€ more expensive, compared to if it had a normal seatpost.

• Suspension stiffness adjustment really makes no difference.

PROS:

• The color. I must say this is one of the best looking bikes in 2020. The turquoise and black combination just looks amazing and stylish. Too many bikes are boring black or gray, without even clearly visible brand name or logo.

• Price. With average price of 1500€, this bike is one of the cheapest high quality full suspension bikes, but still it’s not worse than the ones that cost twice as much.

OTHER:

As usually this bike comes without pedals, mud guards, bottle holder and bike leg. However in my opinion it would be much wiser to include them, and rather sell the bike without seat, because factory seats are always so uncomfortable.

SUMMARY:

While there are some annoying drawbacks with this bike I’m still happy with my purchase. Mainly because other bike manufacturers made the same mistakes and secondly because it’s still one of the best looking bikes out there with quite reasonable pricing. Also if you are a guy, don’t be shy of this bike, it’s as good as men’s bike.

Nevertheless I had to replace following parts in the bike: seat, seatpost, stem and crank. Which was an extra 150€.

P.S. Quite often I have a feeling that the people who build the bikes never ride them. Because how else could they make so stupid mistakes that are noticeable within the first few hours of use?"

MTB,fsn27w,Looking to replace my frameset,"I recently cracked the frame on my Canyon Spectral. [big oof](https://imgur.com/xU1lE51)

Canyon is kindly sending me a new rear triangle, but it turns out this is a common issue with my exact bike, and my 6 years warranty is over in may. Thats why I'm starting to keep some money to the side to buy a different frame in a few months. Thats where I'm gonna need your help.

I don't want to buy a new bike because I've swapped out a lot of parts for really nice ones. If I were to buy a new complete bike, I'd get worse parts because I can't spend 5k on a new bike.

To start things off, I can fix things myself and I like to repair my bike myself. So swapping a frame or fixing up some small things won't be an issue. 

Now to selecting the frame. My perfect bike would be an alloy 140mm/150mm bike that is fairly playful, but has 29er wheels. My main option currently is the Santa Cruz Hightower. Great suspension and lifelong warranty on the frame and bearings. The issue is that it's expensive.

There's also the option to buy a used frame. That way I'm getting a cheap (relative) frame, but without help if I'd crack it again. The other issue is that I probably wont be able to view the frame because there aren't any used frames for sale here in the Netherlands.

What would be the best option? A used frame from a bulletproof brand like Santa Cruz? Or should I bite the bullet and buy a brand new frame. And if you want bonus points, you can recommend me a frame."

I'm running tubeless but I was unsure about the amount of sealant (Stan's) left, I think it's about time to top it up. Since I was still 11 km away from home I decided to add a bit of air pressure (lost a bit when the tire was punctured) and ride it home, with the screw in. I tried to prevent putting to much weight on the back tire and rode easy, paved roads...

Some questions:

* Was driving it home with the screw in the right choice?

How should I continue?

* Top the tire up with sealant and, screw at the bottom, and let it rest a bit.Then pulling it out? Hoping it gets sealed and then ride on like nothing happened?
* Remove the tire assess the damage, try to repair? (how?)
* Buy plugs? And try to plug the hole?

I fear that when I remove the tire without the hole being plugged/sealed somewhat I'll never be able to fix the hole..."
MTB,fsftpu,Fox Racing Canada,"I wanted to give everyone a word of  warning about Fox Racing Canada's return policy.

However neither the representative or their  website mention that shipping back is at the customers expense and Fox  Racing told me they ""do not provide return shipping labels at this tie  nor do we reimburse for shipping fees.

MTB,fsdr5c,Do I really need a FS bike?,"Im want to get back into mountain biking, Ive been away from it for like 10 years, selling my old Gary Fisher HT after kids came along. Been on my roadie for quite some time now, but miss being in the woods and even tooling around the neighborhood on my Allez is not the most comfortable thing in the world. Here in is the problem: There is just too many options, as Im sure all of you know by seeing the numerous ""which bike for me"" (including this) posts. My budget is under $2500, but I still have a hard time paying that much, and for my 40 year old bones, Im not doing any jumps or gnarly rock gardens and the like; just rolling trails through New England and maybe starting my daughter off this year after we get her first ""big girl"" bike. So all this really points to a hard tail, but I really want a FS, but as we know, wants isnt always the same as needs. In this journey, and being an engineer, I took my current shopping list and put it through a cost/performance analysis raking and came up with this:

Basically looking at components, price and weight, ranking them and coming up with a score. 

1) Canyon Neuron 7.0: 130

2) SC Chameleon D: 107.5

3) SC Tallboy D (2019 closeout): 104

4) Commencal Meta TR Ride:  101

5) YT Jeffsy: 99.5

6) Commencal Meta TR Origin:  98.5

7) SC Tallboy D (2020): 97

Looking straight at the numbers, the Canyon is far and away the best value for price and components, and its not even close. With the sale they got going on right now, its $2300 shipped. Not a bad deal, but still not sure if I want to go that high for a D2C bike. Next is the only hardtail Im really looking at, and its a real good value, but still not sure if I want to get a HT or go FS. Last night, I found a 2019 Tallboy on closeout and that brought the value score way up. After that, it looks to be a wash between the other highly recommended bikes, but since they are all D2C, I cant ride them in person so its just a pick'em. Basically, this has turned into a paralysis of analysis. If I had the top three lined up and with a gun to my head told to pick one, I think I would still pick the Tallboy. My buddy has one and loves it, and Ive also ridden it for a bit and could be very happy with it. Next, I would probably choose the HT, just because I think it would probably best fit my needs and price point, but I still think I may be regretful that I didnt get the FS. Third, the Canyon looks on paper to be the best one in terms of componentry, but I know the reviews, here at least, are hit or miss. The others are not really in the running, just helped out to get my formulas right, as flawed as they may be. Writing this post out, I think I know my answer, but wanted to throw it out there anyway. If you were me; 40 something dad who started mountain biking new england in the 90s with a Rockhopper, gave it up for 10 years and wants something cushy for the bones, but  the budget is pointing back to the hard tail...what would you do?"

After toying with blowing the budget on a full suspension rig it seemed that for getting back into the sport a more responsible budget (&lt;$1,000) on a hardtail would serve me better.

With Chain Reaction being sold out of the commonly recommended Nucleus series bikes and the Sentier being discounted to [$799.99](https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/us/en/vitus-sentier-27-bike-deore-1x10-2020/rp-prod181499) I thought that this might be the ticket...until I saw the [Cube Reaction TM Pro](https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/us/en/cube-reaction-tm-pro-27-5-mountain-bike-2019/rp-prod181596). For $100 more (10% off clearance coupon), the Cube includes a dropper post, a RockShox fork, and a 1x11 drivetrain.

Is there anything about the Cube that I'm blind to that would make the Sentier a better choice?

I am starting to look at buying a new bike this year, and I'm torn between 3 options. I plan on traveling  this year to places like Spirit Mountain in Duluth, Copper Harbor in the UP, Moab, maybe some of the gnarly eastern US, and all day adventures out in the middle of nowhere, including local XC trails and places with a lot of climbs \[Traveling is in the air due to the virus...\].  I would like to start doing things that are a bit more gnarly but have efficient climbing ability for those long slogs up.

I narrowed it down to 3 Instinct models/trims. At this point I would like to stay SRAM, but I hear the new Shimano XT 12 speed is ok as well. 

1. Instinct Alloy 30 (I would most likely upgrade right to GX Eagle and add a debonair to the 35 Gold RL fork. )
2.  Instinct Alloy 50 (2 Lbs. lighter almost and has a Pike Select fork which I like. The kicker for me is that it has the Shimano XT and not SRAM.)
3. Instinct Alloy 50 BC Edition (Has GX Eagle, a Fox 36, and longer travel and overall has a nice build. I know 160/155 is overkill for most XC trails, and with climbing/technical climbs, I don't want to be over biked and have a rough time and hate myself for spending the $$ on making a mistake. On the upside, for the downhills, I know it would be able to soak up a bit more.)

I do currently have a XC hardtail (needs a LITTLE work) and a fatbike. 

If you all wanted to weigh in and let me know what you think, that would be great!

MTB,frip5l,Weird knocking sound from the bike,"Hi to all! 

A month ago I bought my first MTB (Norco Sight A3 2019) and just started to ride, but I ran into a problem, and I don’t understand how to solve it and is this a problem at all. 

Some details: Since the time of purchase I managed to ride 15 times, of which 3 times on the mountain on trails. Riding on blue and a few simple black trails. 

So the problem is that about 2 weeks ago I started to hear a weird clicking sound when pedalling that seems to come from the rear shock or down tube. 

By ear, it seems that the sound comes from the middle of the down tube, and not from the suspension. I examined the frame for cracks but found nothing. To exclude the fork and the head tube, I turned the bike over and made a sound pressing the rear suspension only. The sound is not as loud as in the video but annoying as much.

Maybe someone faced a similar situation and knows what could be the problem?

MTB,frfqp4,Fox Float DPS lockout lever problems,My shock has a strong tendency to switch itself into the middle 'trail' position while I am descending. I suspect this may relate to a dirty detent ball or issue with the lockout assembly because it is incredibly easy to change it out of the 'open' position.  Does anyone know of you can take apart the eyelet assembly (lockout lever and rebound knob) without disassembling the rest of the shock. It is covered here: www.ridefox.com/fox17/help.php?m=bike&amp;id=549 but they take apart the rest of the shock first. Many thanks and many cheers!

MTB,freusm,XT Brakes Variable Bite Point (BR-M8020),"Hey all, I'm getting pretty frustrated with my brand new XT brakes having a variable bite point. I think most people are aware this is common in these brakes, they ""pack up"" when you squeeze the trigger in quick succession, and then when you go let go and go to squeeze them again the bite point is now closer to the handlebar which is very disconcerting. I used to have the SLX BR-M7000 and they never did this and I loved those brakes.  


For people with the new M8120, did shimano eliminate this problem in the new iteration?

If I just replace the levers with something else like 8120, XTR, or Saint, would it fix the problem or do you think the calipers are contributing to the issue? I know the M8000 levers have lots of warranty issues similar to the guide levers used to have so I'm thinking maybe it's just the levers...

The brakes have been bled a couple times, pistons lubed and played with etc

MTB,fr2s8a,Hardtail vs FS for beginners,"So I've been riding for years now, and last year I took my gf on a couple of rides. She's pretty enthusiastic about mountain biking, but she was using an old Cannondale hardtail of mine. It's a good, light XC bike that has served me well until last year, when I moved up to a full-sus Specialized. Now, she's pretty happy with the Cannondale, but it's only got a 70mm suspension fork, it's a 26 inch bike, and the geometry is well outdated now. It wasn't until I bought a 2014 full-sus 29er last year that I realised how much my bike was actually holding me back all along - it felt sketchy and I was riding it kinda defensively. My new bike feels so much safer, and in turn, also much more fun. 

So, I'd like to keep my gf safe and enjoying her rides, and I'd like to buy a better bike for her. Let's say the budget is $2000. Seems to me like a decent amount for a nice second-hand FS bike, but I've been looking around and I'm not sure what would maximise her safety without being overkill. Something like 120-130mm, or would something like 140-160mm be even safer, and better? We'll ride in the Alpine region, but climbing won't be avoidable at least sometimes, too.

Side note - is there any other reason except price for going the hardtail route for beginners?"

MTB,fqzf7x,Switching to Shorter Stroke Length?," I've got a 2014 Trek Slash 7, the current Fox Float (DRCV, CTD damper) has an eye to eye length of 8.25 in (209.55 mm) and a stroke length of 2.375 in (60.325 mm). I recently got a really good deal on a Fox Float X2, which has an eye to eye length of 210 mm and a stroke length of 50 mm.  


If I were to swap the rear shock, because the eye to eye length is the same and the only measurement changing is the stroke length, would the only effect be that I lose rear wheel travel? Is it okay for me to go ahead and swap the shock?"
MTB,fqy93g,Loose pedal,"The non-drive side pedal on my Diamondback Sync'r is super loose (not like it's unscrewing, but it just spins with a lot less effort). When I give the drive-side pedal a spin with my foot, it spins around one full revolution, while the non-drive pedal spins like 5 full revs. The only reason this concerns me is because today I hit a jump and the pedal somehow ended up vertical since it's so loose, and when I landed, my foot almost got pretty messed up.

The only thing that looks visually different between the two pedals is the little o-ring on the spindle of the non-drive pedal looks like it doesn't sit evenly. These are the platforms that came stock with the Sync'r (don't have enough dinero to upgrade) and I'm pretty sure it wasn't a problem until now. Is there any way to fix it or get it tighter?"

MTB,fqt4kt,Sitting position(?) issue - Looking for advise,"So, I'm pretty new to any actual mountain biking, always had MTBs for bikes but never rode anything but tarmac or fire roads, really.   
Since I was feeling pumped from watching too many videos online (best way to find and then buy unnecessary stuff, as always) I got myself a [pretty nice bike](https://conway-bikes.de/bikes/emf-527-plus-grey-matt-orange-2873370/) just before winter (I didn't buy blind and properly took a few bikes for a spin!). I have never had a better feeling bike before (as well as expensive). 

A classmate advised me to really go and get a pair of padded riding pants - and went I did.   
Now for my problem, however. When riding, I feel like I'm not sitting on the pads. My sit bone, at least the frontal part of it, is just outside the padded area and the big padded area further back my bum isn't really used much? (That, or it does its job so well I don't even notice it doing its job).

Basically, from my understanding anyways, the black circled part is the sitting bone (on which I should be sitting on completely?) but really all I'm actually sitting on is the frontal edge circled in red.

Now, I really don't believe the riding pants I bought are bad - I'm assuming the problem to be coming from my side.   
Am I sitting 'wrong' due to a bad bike setup? (A.k.a. not really set up at all)  
Is this a 'wrong saddle' type of situation?  
Is this actually alright and this is simply the case since I'm not used to it?

P.S.: I'm not getting any numbness in my legs and other body parts and also no serious pain in my back or so, it's just that this specific spot hurts after around 20-ish minutes in the saddle."

The only problem im running into is finding the wheels so it would be nice if any of yall could recomend wheels with a disc break attachment under $80.

MTB,fpo1m3,Question for heavy weight wheel builders.,"I basically bought a wheel set and got a free Niner out of it.  The setup is i9 Torch hubs, nox farlow 29 rims, and sapim cx-ray spokes.  They are 2x laced and I broke some drive side spokes.   


I am thinking about rebuilding the wheel with help from a friend that has done several wheels and I would like to get prepared and order new spokes.  I am thinking about using the DT Swiss 2.0 straight j bends and going to 3x lacing.  To me, the benefit of going 3x is not having to use 2 different spoke lengths (274/276mm) so I can just order a bulk pack of 284mm spokes (using the spoke length calculator provided by nox).  


I weigh 275lb and still going down, is it worth the little bit of extra weight going to 3x?"

MTB,fpmmyw,I hate using my dropper post,"Recently upgraded to a bike with a dropper, I thought it would be game changing as everyone claims.  I just don't like using it though. 
 I had previously ridden a bike without one and only dropped the seatpost manually for super steep sections of trail, and it definitely helps getting my weight back. Id only lower it a few inches.

I have a 150mm dropper now, but it feels too low when I lower it.   I like to be able to sit down here and there during descents.  I also like the ability to brace the bike between my legs, which I can't do with it dropped.  I feel less comfortable with it in the lowered position when descending.

The problem is it makes the bike feel like it just wants to go straight, I cannot get it to turn at all and constantly feel like I'm gonna hit a tree on the outside of the corner. 

I fixed this feeling last time by putting another 5-10psi in the fork. Steers heaps better, but then I have the issue of harshness and using no where near full travel.

MTB,fp8kjv,"Which suspension system is best? Four Bar, Faux Bar, Virtual Pivot, Split Pivot, etc.?","I found a brief description of the different options on  [https://www.bikeexchange.com/blog/mountain-bike-buyers-guide](https://www.bikeexchange.com/blog/mountain-bike-buyers-guide) :

""Rear suspension comes in many forms. All try to achieve similar things, which is to isolate braking and pedaling forces from the suspension action. **The Four Bar** system is perhaps the most common and features a chainstay pivot, a pivot behind the bottom bracket and a pivot on top of the seat stay which is connected to a leveraged shock linkage. The **Faux Bar** system is very similar to the Four Bar but with pivots on the seat stays. A variation on the Four Bar is the **Virtual Pivot Point (or VPP)** and the **DW-Link** which both use twin links to isolate the rear end. A **Split Pivot** has a rear dropout pivot placed in line with the rear wheel axle, and is virtually the same as Trek's Active Braking Pivot (ABP). A **single pivot** suspension system is the most simple option featuring a swing arm and one main pivot located above and forward of the bottom bracket. The **Floating Drivetrain** so called because the drivetrain is positioned on a link between the front and rear triangles is another popular system.""

They made no official declaration, saying one is better than another, saying, ""All of these systems have pro's and con's, and is sometimes dependent upon the manufacturer as to which system you'll get.""

Are any one of these qualitatively better than another?"

MTB,fp7uvq,Questions about the Jamis Komodo and the value of certain features.,"I posted this in the weekly thread, but it looks kind of dead, and my questions aren't entirely new-bike specific. My apologies if it doesn't belong here.

TL;DR: Need a new bike, ride very aggressively, want a nicer piece of equipment. Read the last paragraph and the questions at the end for a bit more information.

Fairly new rider here, looking for a new bike.

My parents had my dad's old bike, a 2010(ish) Specialized, fixed up for me to ride around campus in September. After 3 tubes ruined by cockle burrs, 2 bottles of Slime, 3 broken chain links, a mysteriously bent front derailleur, an ill-fated ride through a swamp, and about 72,625 aggressive rides across campus, across town, and through local parks, it finally gave out. The final straw was me attempting to fix the bent derailleur and instead bending it so far out of shape that it doesn't touch the chain in any of the three gears. It's technically still ridable, but very close to dead. It would have passed away by now if I was still at school.

My main use for a bike is riding to and then around campus, but even that includes quite a bit of hard acceleration and braking, popping up and down curbs, short flights of stairs, and such. I would also like to be able to go riding down the miles of gravel roads around my parents' house and get into beginner/intermediate trail riding. I know I'm hard on stuff, and I know that quality comes at a premium. I'm fully willing to invest in a very good bike that will suit my needs and stay with me for years to come.

While I know almost anyone here would be able to ride circles around me, I still feel like I'm significantly more comfortable on a bike than your average person. I've messed around enough for fun that I feel I have pretty good control over most things with weight shift, balance, and turning.

Today I went into a bike shop in my girlfriend's very small hometown, just looking to check out her options, and hopefully show her why a Walmart bike is not the answer for her commuting and leisure-riding needs. While she was testing a couple of bikes in the road outside the shop, I talked to the guy about my situation and what I was looking for: My aggressive riding, my uses, and wanting to go for something a bit nicer. What was meant to be a 30 minute trip turned into a bit over two hours as he explained our options, what maintenance and lifespan look like, and a ton of other stuff about bikes. My girlfriend chose one, a Jamis Allegro Femme, that definitely seems like it will be much better than a $150 piece of scrap plastic from Walmart or wherever. He didn't have any mountain bikes past some pretty basic ones because his customer base is primarily people who are looking to ride roads and gravel for fun and family, and not really trying to shred trails, and he is a very small shop in a very small town. He showed me a bunch of bikes in his catalog, from $500 entry-level mountain bikes, all the way up to crazy specced-out beasts that I don't understand for $8000+, just to get a feel for what the complete range looks like. The one that he thought would most likely fit my needs was the Jamis Hardline, or possibly the Komodo. I'm the most interested in the Komodo A2. He said he can order a 2019 or a 2020, with me paying $999 for the '19 or $1,199 for the '20. The difference in the years is the '20 coming with a drop-post and tubeless ready tires &amp; wheels, versus the '19 having a regular seat and tubeless ready rims, but not tires.

So my questions are: 

1) Is the Komodo A2 as good a fit for me as I think? It has most of the suggested options for a good beginners bike in the 'Buying your first bike' post.

2) Is it worth the price tag, or is something about the brand, bike, or anything else problematic?

3) Just how worth are a drop-post and tubeless tires? Especially for me. Are they nice perks, or are they huge advantages? And could I easily do the more useful of the two for less than the $200 difference, or are they major, pain-in-the-ass upgrades?

Thanks."

MTB,fp3xwm,Design me a bike,"This is a unique use case that I don't think exists as an OEM bike, and I already have some custom builds in mind, but I just wanted to know what the community thinks. 

What I want: MTB equivalent of a supermoto motorcycle, which is a dirt bike with street tires. The idea behind one is that you can use it to ride around on roads and highways (quite well due to the power some dirt bikes put out) but if you want to do some light offroad exploring or ride some stairs or do some jumps, you got the chassis and suspension to do it. 

The idea is to get on this thing, ride some 10 miles to the city, explore around, mess around on dirt jumps, and ride back. 

So ideally, this bike needs to be:

* strong but light full suspension frame. Doesnt need to be ultra beefy as Im not planning on sending any huge gaps, but I also want to just drop into a stair set without using brakes from decent speed. 

* very smooth rolling. Trying to get to as close to a cyclocross bike with 42c tires knobs as possible in terms of pedaling efficiency and rolling resistance, which means its gotta be sorta aero. I should be able to average like 12-15 mph. 

* Geometry that is both simultaneously aero while not being sketchy offroad and when riding down stairs. 


Budget is pretty much $10k or below. Obviously a full custom build."

When I tell non-riders I started to Downhill they almost always say ‘its so dangerous you’re crazy’ blah blah, whatever .. the risk is worth it obviously. 

Or was. Cause now theres a double risk.. if I get injured, where am I gonna go? the ER thats 1-filled with Corona patients and highly contagious and 2- a place thats scrambling to keep up to save ppls lives.

And I just got my first real setup and gear and was gonna start hitting local spots regularly, but Im thinking to just actually get in shape properly and wait till this all dies down (hopefully by mid summer)

MTB,fosbxz,I feel like I'm thinking about rebound wrong / can't wrap my head around rebound theory.,"New to MTB. Lifelong BMXer. I live in Los Angeles so I really don't get out to chunk/rock gardens often. My biggest concern is jumps, both standard doubles on level ground and longer lower tables on a steeper grade.

So the basic rebound setting says if you're going fast (and therefore having multiple compressions quickly) use fast rebound. If going slow, climbing and what not, use slow rebound. Of course, having watched many MTBers mess up jump lips by compressing their suspension wrong and popping the lip wrong with their weight, I knew this part would be a struggle.

I think I started jumping at level ground with slow rebound and it felt ""ok"". I moved to a downhill track and sped up the rebound and instantly felt the lurch when leaving lips. But it's hard to tell if my technique is just very amateur and if I can compensate for it.

I spent way too long trying to read about rebound and getting the most mixed bag of contradicting responses in various forums and articles. My ultimate assumption after it all was, for my type of riding, I want medium rebound up front and probably halfway between medium and slow in the rear, if not completely slow. Probably depending on psi/sag.

How does that sound for jumping/popping lips? Nothing is too pogo-y, while the back stays slow and stable so I can pop a bit more like a BMX instead of trying to preload every jump with a dual suspension compression.

Also the bike seems to be one size too small for me so it's very flickable (too flickable) and rather unstable under me at speed so maybe reducing rebound will compensate for the bike feeling like its bouncing all over the place under me.

What do you run at a jump park that looks similar to BMX trails? Thanks."
MTB,fos586,Jeffsey Base/Comp 29 vs. Fuel EX 7 for new mountain biker?,"We recently moved to Park City, UT and I'm coming back to mountain biking after a 25-year hiatus. I'll be riding primarily on the x-country trails here in Park City; no plans for lift-assisted downhill or park.   


I know very little about MTBs, but after a lot of research I've narrowed down to a Fuel EX 7 ($2,900) at LBS or a Jeffsy Base 29 ($2,299) or Comp 29 ($2,999). I've read a bunch of reviews on these bikes but don't even understand half of what they're saying because I'm not familiar with the lingo. They each seem like they'd be more than enough for me, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. 

The LBS gets great reviews and everyone there has been super helpful, so I am leaning toward the Fuel EX 7 if it's comparable to the Jeffsey bikes. But if there's a big difference in quality/components between the Jeffsey Comp 29, which is just $100 more than the Fuel EX 7, then I would consider that. We're buying a bike for my wife and a Kuat NV 2.0 rack from the LBS so hopefully they won't be too bent out of shape if I bring a Jeffsy in there for setup/maintenance. 

My second question is about sizing. If I go with the Jeffsy, I'm between the XL and XXL. I'm almost 6'3, but my legs are on the shorter side for my height; the inseam on my pants is 32 or 33. I'm not sure whether to size up to XXL or down to XL. What do you think?

But, my wife only likes riding on improved paths, so when I ride with her it's a slog to ride my MTB with the big, knobby tires. I have found I do enjoy cycling just for the cardio/scenery sometimes, and definitely like going out to ride with my wife.

I was wondering, is it possible to get a fitness/gravel wheelset with skinny tires that I could drop in to my Fuse? I remember seeing something similar for a Fat bike one time - it was a wheelset that fit the fat bike frame but had gravel/fitness/hybrid/whatever tires.

Is something like this reasonably easy to find/order, or should I just think about picking up a used bike for specifically for that purpose. I mean, N+1 and all, but I don't necessarily need a dedicated bike for cycling as I generally prefer to be on the trails."

MTB,foit4r,XC tires for a 27.5+ Bike?,"First off, I now know I bought the wrong bike. 

I've had my bike (2017 Ralegh Tokul 3) for about 2 years now, and its a good bike, but just the wrong bike for the type of terrain around me.

The two trails I ride most are basically so hard packed it might as well be dust covered concrete, and my aggressive 2.8"" tires are just so slow and energy sucking on them. ( I ride my cross bike on the same trails on 32mm slicks no problem )

Wondering if anyone has any suggestions on a 2.8 or 2.6 tire that is a bit more rolling friendly for super smooth trails. I really don't need all that much tread.

Any recs for tires?"
MTB,foily3,To sell bike or not ? Trek fuel 100 ZR 9000,"So I picked up a 2004 Trek Fuel 100 zr 9000 about 4 years ago for 200 . I'm 5'6 and the frame is a medium.  The the stem is like long but I could always get a shorter one . I feel pretty comfy on the bike but feel like a small would maybe fit me better . The rear fox float rl wont lock out and leaks fluid which I could I'm sure replace seals and put new oil in . I didn't realize that the bike was valued as much as it was , rom what I could find ,originally msrp for 4800 and sells used from 700 to 900. I'm not a huge mountain biker,  I probably dont need a rear shock I go on trails and occasionally a resort but dont go off any big jumps  . Anyways,  I didnt know with it being a 2004 if say the bike was unsafe? It was the bike of some Canadian racer roland green, it has his name with Canadian stickers on it. 
I wasnt sure if I should sell it being an older bike for a newer one that just has front suspension."

Seemingly in response to him putting out tons of videos about their shitty bikes, it seems like Walmart is responding and has substantially improved the quality of some of their bikes.

He posted a review of a hardtail, and it really impressed me in terms what you can get today for less that some of us pay for a dropper post.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTWLS572h2U

While I still wouldn't expect these bikes to survive a proper mountain bike trail, it's a really big step in the right direction.

There's no point in this post other than to express how cool it is that it's possible to great an amazing bike for $2k (and even less if you are talking about hardtails or really budget brands), and how cheap bikes seem to be getting better at the same time.

MTB,fofjww,Tire pressure on tubeless,I'm new to mtb so I'm kind of confused about this. I have both tires tubeless and the psi chart on my fork says the psi can go up to 50 but the guy at the shop told me to keep somewhat around 27-28 in the back and 24 in the front. Does it really make a difference? I certainly wouldn't want to go too high and mess my bike up but I'm still kind of stuck on what psi to keep it on. A few of my friends tell me not to go higher than 30 which sounds fair but is there like a chart for tubeless tires?

MTB,fo9tm2,Please help me choose my new hardtail.,"Hey guys, I’m back in the mtb game and am looking for some help making a decision. I thought I had my final decision settled with the Trek Roscoe 8. I live on Long Island and am looking for a fun and playful bike that is a hoot to ride. Looking to do XC trails but pull wheelies and find anything and everything to jump off of. There’s not many jumps on these trails so I have to get creative most times! I also would like to enjoy the traction when pushing on some speed runs.

The Roscoe is very attractive to me from all the descriptions I’ve read about it. I have a deposit on one from my LBS around the block from my house. Big selling point buying local and having that service available so close. 

Then I stumbled upon the Vitus Sentier 27 VRS. The bike looks awesome. I’m a little concerned about the frame durability but the internet for the most part says it’s okay it seems.

I’m having a tough time debating between the Roscoe above for $1,700 or so... when the Sentier VRS is $1,600 (plus shipping) with such higher spec components, fork, brakes, etc...

What would you guys do? Local support/awesome fun bike or... pay for support everything I need something on the Vitus? Will the Vitus have the same playful personality and fun factor the Roscoe seems to have?

I’ve spent hours deep in research and I’m stuck.

Thanks in advance!"

I am used to being out on the trails for running so the water, electrolights and nutrition that I bring should be good. But what sort of biking supplies should I make sure I have with me? I basically only bring a tube, a CO2 cartridge, and a multitool. My rides have been around 20 miles on rolling hills and sometimes I am pretty far from where my car is and don't want to get stranded. Is there somewhere I can learn about common bike problems and how to fix it? My chain got all messed up the other day and I had to ride back in a high gear to keep it from falling off, which made up hills very difficult. Also when I pass a group of bikers going the opposite direction, what do I say? I have been telling them ""morning, only me"" so they know not to expect other bikers behind me.

MTB,fnfcms,Advice for dropper (travel) upgrade on a Jeffsy,"Beginning of the year I picked up a YT Jeffsy (27.5) XL and I am absolutely stoked with this bike. So much fun riding this beast and performance overall is very solid. The e13 dropper (150mm) on the other hand not so much, within the first 2 months of owning the bike I have had several problems and after it also developed a creak that I can't get rid of, I decided that enough is enough. 

I have done some research and based on what I read a Fox Transfer seems to be the best bet. I really hate creaks and other problems on my bike and the Transfer seems to be very solid. Now my question is with regards to travel, based on the Fox website, with my current saddle height, I would just be able to fit a 175mm (maybe 3mm to spare). Would that work or is it better to go with a 150mm dropper just to have some extra margin? I also saw a Fox Transfer 125mm secondhand (as new), for a significantly lower price. 

Realistically, how much is the travel going to matter? I live in West Europe and we don't have steep sections like BC for example. The Jeffsy is my first FS bike and the first dropper that I have. Thanks in advance for sharing any advice!"

MTB,fnavvv,Debating between drivetrain replacement options?,"My current drivetrain is done. It's a 2x10 setup. The rear derailleur is newish with a clutch but the cassette is long gone and so is the smaller front chainring. In order to replace this, it would cost around $40 for the cassette, and $20 for the front chainring. 

Alternatively, I can switch it to 1x by getting a $50 cassette and a new front chainring. However, the chainrings for 1x setups are a lot more money. I'm looking at the one up chainring because it's got mounting hardware + shims, but it costs around $60. Are there any cheaper options? Would a cheap ebay chainring work?

Another option is waiting for a groupset take off. I've seen SX eagle groups go for $250 brand new. This would give me new cranks, cassette, chain, bb, shifters, everything. My shifters/cranks aren't going bad, but they are showing their age.

Which option would you recommend going for?"
MTB,fn9mcq,What MTB youtubers do you watch?,"As I've just started MTBing I've of course been diving into youtube and... Some of these guys are weird. I suppose it's no different than any other hobby/genre with how youtube is these days...

But who do you watch for solid, consistent content that isn't too repetitive?

Can only watch so much BKXC worrying about falling and Seth actually falling. My favorite one so far is Jordan Boostmaster because he tries to keep a lot of variation in his uploads whether it's strictly jumping or chunky downhill or a fun theorycraft video on narrow bars or small wheels, etc.

Anybody else like that? Thanks"

MTB,fn5mrn,Whyte G170s v2 or YT Capra,"Hey guys, I’ve had a stuntjumper fsr elite since 2011 and think it’s about time to change up my bike. Budget is a thing for me so I’m looking for bikes under £3k. I have in mind the Whyte and Capra as they’re around the same price point. 

I’m not that up to date on spec information and such so I was wondering if anyone knew much about the bikes and could suggest which is the best bang for the buck. 

Just abit of background about my riding, normally I ride in local mountains or ‘woods’ as we call it. Requires cycling to the top before going down, I doubt I’ll ever take the bike on a lift. Generally the trails are classed as enduro/dh..... most have large tree roots/stumps, rock drops and 3-5ft jumps and drops. 

I’d love any help as I haven’t shopped for a bike in 9 years !!!"
MTB,fn4851,Stumpjumper st 2020 or stumpjumper st comp 2019,Both are priced really well. Trying to see whether or not to spend the extra money for the 2019 comp in the 29 or go with the 2020 st 29. Mostly ride local fire roads and trails like Fullerton loop. Nothing crazy. Might want to try a bike park later down the line. But mainly fire roads for now. What would you go with? Price between the two aren’t super crazy.
MTB,fn3zqo,Thinking of visiting WNC while you are able to work remote/spring break/etc? Please don't.,"The quantity of out of state plates I've been seeing in the Asheville/Brevard (DuPont / Pisgah) area in the last two days is astounding. The trailheads were busier than I've ever seen them and full of cars with out of state plates, both common biking areas and hiking trails. What is worse is that many of them are in large groups, I passed at least 3 groups of 8 or more people yesterday alone and saw several others driving in. Normally, I'd be stoked to see this many people coming to enjoy the area, but in the midst of the current situation, it's scary.

We have a large population of elderly people in this area and a severe shortage of hospital beds. If the spread here is the way it has been in other areas, it will be devastating to these communities here. 

I get that it's hard to stay where you are, but showing up from out of state during a pandemic on non-essential travel is irresponsible. Not only is it potentially spreading the disease, but you put these areas locals use to exercise at risk of closure because of the group sizes and quantity of people showing up. I also know several emergency calls were made into the forest this weekend, which is straining an already strained system. Most local businesses are changing their behavior to prevent the spread, during what is one of the busiest times of the year, yet people are flooding the forest from out of state.

So if you have plans to visit this area over the next few weeks or months until this passes, please don't. Stay local and wait it out.

Oh and social distancing isn't riding with 8 people on singletrack. That's exactly what you aren't supposed to be doing."

I have a trek mtb, I bought it in hopes of riding some local trails but I’ve never really given it a shot yet ( more focused on road biking when I have a chance).  I think it’s a trek marlin 5 , model year is 2018 or 2019. Does anyone know of a solid child trailer that won’t break the bank and that I can use with the 29 in wheels.  It’s got disc brakes but has QR skewers. I was looking at the instep ones on amazon but someone in the reviews claimed that instep says they shouldn’t be used with bikes that have bigger than 26 inch wheels.

Any insight would be great, insteps site is horrible.

Basically, I did lower leg service myself for the first time myself and retardedly wrenched the knob counter clockwise thinking that would loosen the screw that holds the lower fork to the upper instead of just pulling it out.. and when I finally figured out what was wrong and got the lower off, I pulled out that screw and it looks chipped and when you turn the knob (or use another hex wrench) it doesn't adjust the rebound.

I understand that the Full Stache will be more work with trying to climb since it’s heavier and softer in the suspension; but how much more difficult?

MTB,fmpoev,"My 2019 Nukeproof Mega - A cautionary tale. (Warning, extreme bicycle horrors within)","Greetings fellow MTBer's, I am sharing this cautionary tale with you so you may avoid the horrors I have enduro'd. 

Last year, I was excited to purchase a bike. My old workhorse was becoming outdated in every standard imaginable and it was tricky getting the parts I needed for her. I was excited to enter a new longer and slacker world and buy a new enduro sled. 

After much debate and research, I found a deal on chain reaction cycle's site for a brand new Nukeproof Mega 275 Elite. Carbon frame, Lyrik up front, Eagle drivetrain, Beautiful Mavic Deemax Elite wheelset, and race-winning Michelin tires. All for under $3k, USD. My pp was very happy, indeed.

After a quick build, she was ready to rock and looking beautiful. First ride in, unfortunately got a flat. ""Ah well,"" I think, ""these things happen."" Second ride, flat again, on the front wheel. These paper-thin tires that come with it are garbage. ""Ah well,"" I think, ""Most manufacturers include crap tires anyway"". 
New Maxxis tires setup! Time to ride, baby. Let's go on the third ride. I get about 1 mile in, jump off a small kicker, and as I land my rear wheel locks up, I come to a screeching halt. The rear spokes declared ""Looks like drivetrain's back on the menu, boys!"". Three spokes are broken. One of them stabbed through the rim tape (just for lulz I imagine) spraying out sealant and compressed air everywhere. I walk back out of the woods carrying my wounded soldier on my back. I didn't understand. I didn't hit anything, the hanger wasn't bent (check it with hanger alignment tool), the minimum limit adjustment was set so it could juuust make it into first gear. 

So I buy a new Eagle derailleur and oh my, what's this weird tool that comes with it? Turns out that b-adjustment is really important for Eagle, and CRC never set that up from the factory, nor did they include the tool with the bike. The derailleur pulley was so far away from the cassette the chain managed to flex beyond first gear and wrap around the cassette, eating everything in its path. ""Oh well,"" I thought to myself, ""guess I should have known"".
I install a new chain, new derailleur (with b adjustment correct now!), and  *can't* go for a ride because I can't find those weird ass proprietary spokes. Turns out now many stores carry this shit in America. I ask Mavic, they point me to their find-a-dealer on their website. It lists two, one of the dealers doesn't answer the phone, the other says they can't get it. CRC's customer service says they can't get them. Nukeproof customer service (who I found out is also owned by the same parent company as CRC), is useless after not answering for two weeks. I luck out and find a roadie shop near me that carries Mavic. They get me the spokes. There are three different style spokes on the wheelset. To get spares for all three, it is 90 FUCKING DOLL HAIRS FOR SPOKES. And you only get three spokes per bag! ""OH WELL"", I thought to myself, ""THESE THINGS HAPPEN"". 

At least I get to ride my damn bike. Its fourth ride time, baby. Time to get to that bike park! Brapping and shralping commenced. But as the day goes on, I think more and more to myself, ""gee this fork is rough! I need to learn how to adjust it better"". The day goes on further. My arms are killing me, low speed compression is all the way off, and these is no high speed on this model. I lower the air pressure. It helps, a little. Next lap, it gets harder?? Again?? I lower the air pressure. By the time I'm at the bottom of the trail, this fork is so rock hard I swear it has a fluffer working for it. I let out all the air pressure, for fun. The fork does not go down. In fact, it STILL a little stiff. Rando dude who happens to fix suspension for a side hustle sees what's going on and recommends to burp it and hoo lee fuk. A BLAST of air comes out. ""I've never seen that much air stuck in a lower before!"", he says. ""This needs to go back for warranty!"" I continue to ride but as the day goes on it requires more and more burping to keep it from firming up.

Fantastic. I contact CRC by phone, hah, try again they are only open 9-5 Zimbabwe Central time. 
Try calling again the next day. ""Sorry, high call volume. Bye!"" YOU CAN'T EVEN WAIT, THEY JUST FLAT OUT SAY NO!
Email them, no answer for 4 days.
Email again, they said ""sounds like you fixed it tho, homie"".
Email again, they said ""try lowering the air pressure"". 
Email again, they said sounds like you fixed it homie. 

They clearly aren't even reading the prior emails. This is a shitshow. I finally get them to agree to take back the fork after about a week and a half of emails. It's going to cost me 60 bucks to get it shipped back to these morons. I throw my homies at the local shop 20 bucks and they get it to rockshox. 5 weeks later I have a fork again, SRAM said they found no problems. The shop says they had the same problem with their rockshox fork and it took them 4 times back and forth to get it resolved, only after replacing the entire upper assembly. 

Whatever, I finally have a bike again. Time to ride before I end up at the funny farm. Me and my homie are at the park again, shredding some gnar mercilessly. The gnar forces band together to shred back. The victim: double down maxxis minion. When your bikepark consists almost entirely of loose sharp rocks, these things happen. Wrestling on a new tight tire in the parking lot, I think ""Yes, almost on there you son of a bitch, wait WTF where is my cassette?"" The thing fell off. It just fell the fuck off. Turns out this is a Mavic hub ""feature"". Tool-less disassembly. I can't tell you how many people in the MTB world demand that their cassettes fall off at any moment while they are working on their wheel trail-side. Great work Mavic. I see also my hub has disassembled itself. Awesome. After about an hour, I find all the greasy parts covered in dirt and dust. By the time I get everything cleaned up, lubed replaced, and back assembled, its time to leave. Mydisappointmentisimmeasureable.jpg. Some of the parts aren't sold by Mavic, so you've got a useless wheelset if you lose something like the axle end cap. 

I've had trouble with pinch flats (even on DOWNHILL casing tires) cuz I ride in a lot of rocky trails, so I invested in cushcore. If you don't know, you HAVE to get the tire in the center section of the rim if there is any hope of getting those tires on. Well guess what, the center channel of the rim is about 1/3 two 1/2 of the size of a normal rim center channel. It's impossible to install.

You guys, its too late for me. I am taking up yoga and I fear the local gnar will never feel my wrath again. I have about 100 miles on this bike, 7 flat tires, 1 bad fork, broken spokes, replaced rim tape 4 times, new derailleur. Overall 1,000 bucks in tools, replacement parts on top of the cost of the bike. This bike is cursed, hell I might be too. If anyone has made it this far, stay away from CRC unless maybe you live in the UK and can go to a shop in-person or sue their asses. Thank you for reading my tale. 

TL;DR, Chain Reaction Cycles is the devil and that deal on a bike you see on their may or may not cost you your sanity and many hard earned dollars."

MTB,fmmbgz,Buying a bike amidst covid19,"Hey all. Long story short, I am looking for a new trail bike this year. If this post belongs elsewhere let me know. I figured with all of us doing mostly nothing, it might not be a bad time to get some opinions. I sold my bike last fall with the intent on getting something newer and slightly more aggressive. I had a stock 2016 stump jumper carbon comp and it served me very well for my first bike and honestly, i think its well suited to my trail system (northern utah). Now, i am trying to decide on a new bike and am between online and in person as i am trying to be responsible given the recommendations of social distancing and i realize that buying a mtb is most certainly not essential.  I am looking for FS, alloy, 140mm+ travel, with modern geometry that isnt a total hog to climb. While i am looking used, i am not opposed to buying new as i realize there is value in warranty, budget is US$2-3k. I usually climb all of my routes, I am not very sendy, like big rides but do not desire to be XC, and will rarely if ever touch a bike park and will certainly not hit the ""big line""."

MTB,fmkqke,Rant/What do I do next?(large scale),"I was bitten by the bike bug in december, what followed was rekindled love for bikes.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was growing up I raced bikes, it was casual because my dad raced xc(I just raced because I had the chance). My life after I stoped racing fell through, I became a video game addict, overweight, other problems, etc. I turned 15 and realised that I finally have the ability to impact my own life, and bikes are a great outlet.(Im turning 16 soon for scale)

Over the years I've accumulated 3 bikes, a 2013 merida dakar 624(24"" kids bike that I raced), a 2003 schwinn solutions fs aluminum(Basically rescued from the trash), and lastly a trek 2004 6500(also saved from the trash). The merida bike had a mangled derailleur that I fixed until one of the pedals stripped the threads on the crank arm(;-;). The schwinn bike is mostly operational, but the bottom bracket  bearings are shot(;-;). But the trek bike is in the process of being fully rebuilt (on a budget). And I have them split across 2 locations, with the kids bike and disassembled trek about 30km away from me now.

I'd like to do xc, but I'm more interested in bmx, pump track, dirtjumping, etc. But there aren't any dirt jumps here, yeah there are skateparks, but my goal would be to move out of bmx bikes to something more like slopestyle bikes/dirt jumpers, even though there arent any dirt jumps here? I dont know how to explain it closet I got is: I want to fly, but I like mountain bikes­ not bmx. There aren't any trails here, atleast any marked/real trails so dh is out of the picture.

The corona/distanced schooling is going to last 3 more weeks, so as long as I can take care of my shoolwork I can ride all day, but I only have a bike with a wiggly bottom bracket, it's not gonna stop me, but I'll be riding more reserved. I have records to break, I got riding to do. Sitting here and watching some videos from max fredriksson, I had a moment of clarity, *what even is my end game?* I know you'd all tell me in the comments to just enjoy riding, but a goal would help me to not go off track. I'm going to be doing multiple rides of \~20 km every week because I finally have the opportunity. I dont have the money to build/buy a bike for xc or dirt jumps, I don't got a buddy to race/ride with. I'm just in a place where I can go down one of many roads and have no idea which is the right or best road.

I live in the city, but because of the pandemic I'm currently in the country side, living the bike life. When this all ends, I'm going to buy a bmx to finally get a chance to fly. But what next? Do I just become a street rat at that point? Do I have the fun of my life doing jumps, or commit to xc? I kinda got scared of the tendancies of the bmx community, I've watched some videos of bmx fests and meetups, and people there go crazy. Because of my past I don't want to end up like that. Maybe that's why I want to ultimately move to bigger bikes, to remain in good relationships with the bmx community, but keep a healthy distance. I know full well that my opinin is wrong and not based at all, just some trauma I went through.

&amp;#x200B;

Rant over. Thanks for reading through my unstructured life story, hope you dn't get a migraine reading through xD. I realise that my opinions are mostly very wrong, they change so quickly. This was light hearted, no real heart and soul went into this. I just wanted to collect my thoughts together and see what the outcome would be.

MTB,fm9iqn,Help with dog that barks while chasing on rides.,"Hi folks, so my main riding partner is my dog. From other posts on r/MTB, I know this can be a contentious issue, to which I’ll just say that he’s polite and knows to stay out of the way. Also, he’s a healthy 2-year-old mutt who did not join me on rides until the 1-year mark, and since I mostly ride fairly xc-ish and intermediate enduro trails, I’m not worried about injuring him. 

Unfortunately, recently he’s decided it’s fun to continually bark while chasing me, or whomever is the fastest in our group. While this is usually just a bit annoying, sometimes he’ll chase people in another nearby group, thinking they are riding with us, which is obviously not cool. 

So, before I decide I need to leave him at home, has anyone else dealt with this issue? I’ve had some success when it’s just me and him by simply stopping the ride whenever he starts barking and giving him a stern “no”, and then waiting awhile before starting again. This takes the fun away and (I think) is starting to sink in a bit. 

Any thoughts? He’s a good boy who LOVES coming on rides with me. I’d hate to leave him at home, but obviously will do so if his behaviour doesn’t improve. 

Thanks."

MTB,fm3v1b,It can happen to any of us.,"I have been seeing a lot of ""me and the boys social distancing"" posts lately.  THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BE GOING OUT RIDING WITH ANYONE.  THIS IS NOT A FUN UNPLANNED HOLIDAY. 

I'm sure a lot of you are already starting to roll your eyes but I think the MTB community needs a slap on the face right now. 

Sure, go get exercise and blow off steam but do so by yourself.  All the guidelines that everyone is taking as hard fast rules on how to be safe are simply just best practices.  Staying 5 feet from your buddies isn't going to magically keep the virus away.  Every time you interact with someone you are not just interacting with just them you are interacting with everyone they interacted with that day.  

Anecdote time.  Friend got positively diagnosed two days ago.  Super fit mid 20's dude with no kids.  Prior to that he had been out on several rides with a few friends in the last week.  While he was out riding he felt fine.  Two days ago he feels like he has been hit by a truck.  Hes doing OK now but its still bad at least he's out of the ER.  The worst part, now everyone he rode with is potentially infected.  Now those people have to figure out how to stay away from family for several days to make sure they didn't get it.

Basically there will be times for buddies, beer and high fives when this all blows over.  If we can all do our part we can hopefully make this go away faster."

MTB,flyjiw,Switching Whips: '09 Trance X to '19 Trance 29,"About a month ago I switched from a 2009 Giant Trance X (26er) to a 2019 Trance 29 (both in Large), what follows are descriptions of technical and ride impression differences. The ’19 Trance 29 has slacker geometry, bigger wheels, updated suspension, and a dropper post. Having upgraded most components on the ’09, it’s lighter. Travel on the ’09 is 120mm front and rear, whereas the ’19 is 130 front, 115 rear. Despite the similar suspension numbers, the ’19 feels much more plush when landing or hitting technical trail features. Of course, it also rolls over roots more smoothly. 

The ’09 drivetrain is 3x9, whereas the ’19 is 1x12. I’m spending more time in my granny gear climbing on the ’19, which I attribute to a combination of my lost aerobic conditioning over winter and the ‘19s more aggressive tires with greater rolling resistance, and a more aggressive granny gear. I’m hoping to condition my way out of this. 

I’m just starting to get the hang of the dropper post. It helps going over logs, though I feel a bit odd riding with the seat down—guess I’m just not used to it. I see the potential for helping with jumps, I can start with my body lower going into a jump; but I haven’t realized it yet. I’ve never been much of a jumper, and I’m still learning how to get this 29er off the ground, it feels bigger with deeper suspension. When I occasionally get a good launch, it feels sweet. 

The handlebars are much wider. I’m considering trimming them back an inch or so.

Happy to hear any pointers on transitioning from a steep 26er to a slack 29er with a dropper."

Raking, digging, and trail maintenance is a relatively safe activity that will pay dividends later in the season!

I encourage everyone who can to find a shovel or rake and go spruce up your trails. If they are wet, go walk them and dig trains to dry them out (I did this last week to great success). 

Go fix up the lips to your favorite jumps. Go patch holes in the berms. Do some pruning and remove dead branches. Rake some leaves. Do your part to help your trails out! 

If your trails are dry, ride safe and smart! 

I am probably not going to ride anytime soon because (1) my trails are mostly too wet, and (2) the quickest drying trails near me also happen to be the steepest and most technical, and I would feel incredibly guilty if I hurt myself and had to go to the ED."

If there are any riders in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area looking for a sweet place to jump on their MTB, some friends and I  have started a few jumps in the desert which is now starting to transform into a full on bike park with multiple lines. So far the main line has a 12 foot double a 10 foot river gap followed by a berm then a gap over a berm and then a dirt tabletop. We also have another secondary line as well as a third main line in the works. There are also various jumps and lines that are unfinished/need work spread throughout the compound.

MTB,fkssko,What do you guys think about the black boxing of E-MTB motors?,"I'm not sure whether this is the correct place to discuss this, but I'll try posting here anyway. 

E-MTBs have made mountain biking much more accessible to a load of people, there's no denying it. It can be a great way to get more exposure on this sport. And for that, I do support the idea of E-MTBs. 

However, I do see that there is a worrying trend with how the whole motor industry is going. This is gonna give me some pause to getting an E-MTB, or even recommending them to anyone.

And that is user serviceability, or lack thereof. 

Most motors nowadays are sealed and not serviceable at all, just taking em apart by yourself voids the warranty. Hell, Shimano motors are the only motors I know of which you can update the firmware yourself. Just bring it to a service center, you say? This might not be possible for some of us, and others might have their own reasons to work on their bikes themselves. The bike industry has always given us the option to wrench on our own bikes, without fear of voiding warranties(unless you're a real special breed of dumbass). Why have they taken away this option for E-MTBs? 

Then there's the problem of finding spare parts or schematics for your motor, battery or the like. Your motor is out of warranty and it just blew. You try to find schematics for your motor, but there's nothing. As the motor is out of warranty, you take it apart anyway, locate the faulty part, and try to search for it online. Only to have nothing turn up. Your only option now is to get a completely new motor. This is in stark contrast with the rest of what's on your bike. You can get any spare part for almost any component you care to name. Broken the cage of your derailleur? There's a spare derailleur cage which you can easily buy out there. Exploded the damper on your fork? No problem, just order another damper online. Not everyone of us can afford to buy a completely new motor, or fork, just to keep riding. And we have that option with the fork, but not the motor. 

Lastly, there's the issue of upgradability. Most people can build and customize their bikes however they like. There's a wide selection of fork, shock, handlebars, stems, drivetrain, wheels, brakes, you name it, for the person to choose to spec on their bikes. However, for E-MTBs, you're stuck with whatever motor and battery came on your bike. Don't like it? Too bad. Wanna upgrade your battery to that larger capacity one that brand just announced? Yea, not happening, you peasant. Unless you go buy a new bike with that.

As such, even if my country suddenly decided to lift all the heavy restrictions on electric modes of transport tomorrow (yes, I live in Singapore, where E-MTBs are practically banned), I'll just sit on my arse for that bit longer to see where the motor industry is going. 

Again, I'm not against getting an E-MTB. I just want to ensure that it's an sound investment which I do not have to throw away after X number of years. I'm pretty sure that's the case for almost everyone who's willing to drop a few thousand for a bike."

Very close to pulling the trigger on a canyon spectral al 6.0 but unsure due to sizing.

I looked at the rear suspension and only about an inch of it was uncompressed.

MTB,figypb,How long have asymmetric chainrings been a thing?,"I’m a relatively casual MTBer, using my old Kona mostly for getting to work, so I’m not up on all the current new standards.

So when I decided to replace the 40T ring on my crank with a 36T and make it a 1x8 setup (it’s a really old Kona), I jumped on to Amazon, saw one that was a remarkably good price and hit buy. It just turned up and the bolt pattern is all wrong. 

So yeah, I’ve just learned that asymmetric bolt patterns on chainrings are now a thing. Why? Does it serve any purpose, beyond being another thing that you have to think about, another ‘standard’ that serves only to make people have to spend more money?"

MTB,fi9no8,Please help me make component comparisons between a 2020 Strive CF 8.0 and a 2019 Strive CFR 9.0,"I'm trying to compare these and understand a SRAM build vs a FOX &amp; Shimano one. I'm probably over thinking it but here it goes:

Things that matter to me in frame and components: Longevity, ease of maintenance, performance and durability. 

Use case: Looking for a bike that can do it all, from light trail use to bike park days every now and then. Mostly a trail rider though

That being said, I've never actually ridden Fox VS Rockshox, SRAM VS Shimano, so I have no concrete basis for any preferences besides general knowledge gathered on YouTube. Please feel free to enlighten me on strengths and weakness between the two.

[2020 Strive CF 8.0](https://www.canyon.com/en-us/mountain-bikes/enduro-bikes/strive/strive-cf-8.0/2240.html?dwvar_2240_pv_rahmenfarbe=BK&amp;dwvar_2240_pv_rahmengroesse=XL) To start, I'm a big fan of this build. New XT 12 speed drivetrain, Fox suspension. I prefer it because of the new Shimano drivetrain tec as well as their easy to bleed brakes and FOX's reputation. It's basically the dream build I thought I wanted. Both my ""prefered"" component manufacturers, but as mentioned I have no real grounds for this quite yet.

[2019 Strive CFR 9.0](https://www.canyon.com/en-us/outlet/mountain-bikes/strive-cfr-9.0-team/50013467_M06601V18J0105.html) Last year's top model. Fan of the CFR frame, but I'm unsure about other bits. A hydraulic reverb is strike one from me. Are these really as bad a people make them out to be? I've heard countless horror stories about these. Also, I know Rockshox's released a new version of this fork and rear shock, are the ""older"" ones on this bike still worth getting? Also how are the codes? All around just an uneasy, unfamiliar feeling related to SRAM/Rockshox.


What bike would you pick, why? Thanks for any information provided it's much appreciated."

As far as I know, hope pro 4 has a 11spd freehub body and to use 9/10 spd cassettes you'll need a cassette spacer.

MTB,fhvrww,Working on wheels and spokes. Doable?,"I just finished a complete overhaul of my bike. Only the wheels needed a proper checkup. So I went to the local wheel specialist to let them get checked. 

He removed the rim tape on one of the wheels to check something? (No idea why they did that, but send a mail to inform. Don't think he changed my wheel).

He checked tension and it turns out all spokes are somewhat too loose. The driver side spokes might need replacement. They made an offer to do this, but it was too pricey for the age of the wheels. So I decided to not do it. 

The wheels still run fine without real problems. But it made me thinking: I believe I need to know how to do this as well. 

Is it possible for a home mechanic to check wheels and care for them? I think about ordering a simple spoke tension checker which can be bought quite cheap and just start taking care of my wheels myself. Any tips on how to do this?"

MTB,fhoemd,got a couple injuries. should I sell my bike?,"Part 1: so in Sept I tore a ligament in my knee riding bike park. 6 months of PT later, my knee is finally feeling mostly normal and I got cleared to ride. However, a lower back pain I was having at the end of last season has gotten much worse and I can barely ride 5 miles without having to get off my bike and stretch. On top of that, I have a mystery injury in my shoulder (either skiing or lifting, I'm not sure which) that has persisted for 3 weeks now and isn't getting better. I took a riding vacation last week to a world renowned MTB area, and got one ride in before I realized my shoulder and lower back (and fitness, from being off the bike for so long) weren't going to allow me to enjoy any riding. I have an appointment with my PT for the shoulder, but it will be a couple weeks. I lost my whole ski season, I usually ski about 80 days a year doing double black diamonds, this year I've done 5 blue groomer half days. I've ridden about 5 mellow days on the bike since the ligament injury. 

Part 2: I have a 1-season-old high end ""dentist brand"" carbon everything enduro bike that is on its 3rd model year, i.e. it will probably be fully revised for next year, meaning the value of my bike is going to drop like a rock. I've been watching the selling price of these bikes, and with the build I have, in its current condition (quite good), it seems I could get $4500-$5k for it if I sell it now (less than 50% of retail). If I wait until next season when the new model drops and it's a year older, I'm guessing I'll be lucky to get $2500 out of it. 

so...I'm wondering if I should sell it while it's worth some money and focus on therapy and yoga and fitness and my non-bike/non-ski hobbies for this year so I'm strong and healthy and fit for next ski and bike season and cut my losses. 

there is one other consideration, which is I won't likely be able to afford this nice of a bike for next year. Would prob be looking at a used bike (and therefore no warranty, whereas my current bike has a 10 yr warranty with 9 years left on it) or maybe something like a Commencal or YT direct to consumer brand. 

Thoughts? I hate to be without a bike, and don't really know the severity of my shoulder and back issues, but I'm kind of tired of limping along trying to enjoy my hobbies injured and could use the money for other things."

MTB,fhnlki,SRAM GX cassette issues," 

Hey all!

I'm trying to find out if I'm having a known issue with my cassette or if it's unique to me.

I  noticed notchy cartridge bearings in my Formula rear hub (12x148), and  took it to the LBS to get new ones pushed in. They called up and said  the new bearings were in, but the SRAM GX 12 speed cassette is  interfering with the free movement of the axle. The only way they found  this out was by putting a fresh cassette on the wheel after they had  replaced the bearings.

My question  is, a) has anybody else experienced this and b) considering the parts  involved are less than a year old and I haven't messed with them at all  until this issue, should I try and get them warrantied?

My dealer is JensonUSA, which has shite service for warranty claims. FML.

We have 3 days to spend in the area, likely will be renting a truck to haul everything around.

Terrain and riding preferences: From New England, riding full squish trail bikes on our mini-mountains and hills. Close to home (Rhode Island) are lots of very technical quick climbs and short downhills full of roots and rocks for our trail rides, usually 10-15 mile loops. Then there are the epic trips to the Green Mountains in Vermont. Kingdom Trails has a ton of well-maintained flow trails and some technical mixed in. The new enduro area has a grueling fireroad climb with well-rewarded descents that we love to lap. Lastly, we mix in some lift-accessed fun with DH at Killington Resort, hitting the techy steeps up top and sending Black Magic jump lines at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Where should we spend our 3 days in the Seattle area? We like long days in the saddle. Mix of tech and flow, happy to climb and be rewarded with epic descents. Bonus points for some dope loops (10-20mi)."

Just watching Friday Fails on Pinkbike and from my own experiences on bikes and skateboards seem to show that I'm going to hit the ground upper body and arms/elbows first

Is it because knee injuries are harder to rehab? 

Is it 'the fashion' ?

Is it because they're annoying to wear when pedalling up and can't be slipped down like knee pads, although you're not flexing the elbows in the same way as knees...

MTB,fgtbxl,Low end new bike vs Mid-level used bike,"I'm comparing these two as a first bike. I am quite sensitive about spending close to a grand let alone closer to 2k for a first bike, but also like the idea of having a good bike that I can grow into. One is a 29er, but based on my research and what I'm interested in, I decided it's not a negative in any regard to go with 27.5.


The new low end bike is 2020 Canyon Neuron AL 6.0 (29er) for $1500+tax

https://www.canyon.com/en-us/mountain-bikes/trail-bikes/neuron/neuron-al-6.0/2504.html

The used mid-level bike is 2015 Giant Trance 1 (27.5) for $950 flat which is cleared by a very reputable and experienced bike shop (normal inspection, not taking anything apart). Blue Book value if that matters is around $1400..

All of this got me thinking about how much I'm constantly using all of my rear suspension travel and I'm wondering what are all my options to upgrade. Currently running a Rockshox Deluxe RT3 with extra volume spacers and increased air pressure. The modifications helped but I think I'm dinging my rims so much for bottoming out the shock all the time. Does anyone have experience with the Megneg on this bike?

I do not hit jumps at all. Is this a good bike for both climbing and descending and going over simple obstacles like trees across the path and rocks downhill?

MTB,fgckcv,"Strap in, gunna be a wild season!","With the super mild winter we had, I think our rides this year will be super troublesome. I’m just outside Boston and have been out in the unseasonably warm days we’ve had the last few weeks and noticed some things. First, I usually don’t get out until end of March/mid April. Won’t even attempt before because the trails are mud. They are very dry given the time of year. Not sure how the lack of winter will affect the trails themselves. I know one thing.... the thorn bushes never died this winter. They are overgrown now, and the season hasn’t even started. Gunna be a huge problem even with trail maintenance. Also we’ve had a ton of ants already indoors. Again, not normal. This will probably be the worse bug season I have ridden in as well.

MTB,fgc9tz,Unresponsive brakes on brand new bike,"Hello!
I'm a complete beginner and I picked up my first bike today. The bike is brand new and was assembled at my local bike shop. On my way home, I felt like the brakes felt pretty loose. I've heard that it's a good habit to only use one finger for braking but I could get very limited braking power with just one finger. The first 50% of the travel felt completely unresponsive and the last 50% required pretty hard pressure to acually brake. 

Brakes are:

	Shimano MT201 Disc#180/F and 160/R SM-RT10 CL rotor

I've read that hydraulic brakes can require bleeding but my brakes are brand new. Do I need to adjust anything or will they become more responsive after using them for a while?"

MTB,fg5tqo,Help with wheels. Most likely Cush core.,"So I refilled my wheels with some sealant today. Both wheels have cush core (pain in the ass to install last year). Issue I had was on the rear wheel after pouring some sealant in and filling air I couldn’t deflate. The front wheel immediately overflowed with sealant and I rushed to fill with air to force sealant in. I’m assuming the Cush core slid over the valve. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? What was the solution? How can I shift the Cush core without removing the wheels? Don’t want to deal with that again."

MTB,fg17gt,I've rebuild my bike. I now have a new bike.,"A few weeks ago I started with fixing my sagging dropperpost. After this I noticed a slight wiggle in the suspension. Turned out all the bearings in the rear were shot. Then I thought:well let's give the shock and the front fork some proper maintainance while I'm at it. 

And although I had a lot of hurdles along the way. Parts breaking or not fitting it all worked out fine. 

The first ride after the rebuild was pure bliss. The bike seems more subtle in it's suspension than when it was new.  But what struck me the most is the insane stability it added. I was always really handy on my bike and capable of pushing it hard. Doing the same stuff feels like a breeze right now. As if the bike is being bored and wanting to go faster. 

And while some might say this is boring, it actually means I'm able to experience more lines and have more fun making the lines more flowy. My bike suits my style again. It's really reassuring knowing I now know the bike in and out, and knowing that I can fix and maintain almost every part. 

Only thing left to do is taking the wheels to a pro for a tune-up and then the bike is ready to shred again."

MTB,fg01zv,YT jeffsy sizing (old frame design),"Howdy partners, I made a thread a little while ago asking for advice on buying a mountain bike and have decided to go with none of them and get a jeffsy 27.5 instead !

The other options before were kona process 153, rocky mountain thunderbolt or altitude, and ibis ripmo af. 

The issue I ran into now is with sizing. YT has the previous generation AL base on their website for a good deal that's totally within my budget and seems better spec'd than even the new gen AL base and I am unsure about a carbon frame on the other models to get a better spec. 

The only size left in stock however is xl and I am 6'1"". I have read about the seat tube length issues people have, and I am right on the cusp with an inseam of about 34.5-35"". Yt on the phone mentioned it shouldnt be a problem, but the whole reason I am thinking jeffsy is it is supposed to be playful and I am therefore hesitant to size up. Any help?

We've seen a large increase in the number of ""which bike should I buy"" and ""is product X worth Y"" posts lately, and the vast majority would be better suited for the Weekly New Rider Thread. Moving these questions to the correct thread will not only prevent the front page of /r/mtb from being overrun with posts seeking purchasing advice, but will also expose them to a larger audience of people eager to *give* purchasing advice. 

One other thing to consider is the amount of information you include in your comment. ""Worth"" is a relative concept, so shaving a few grams off of your drivetrain main be ""worth it"" to a rider with a lot of disposable income, but no so much to a starving college student.

After a short lil 10.2mi ride today I still found it to be relatively uncomfortable and high pressure on my pelvis. Wondering if anyone has any advice or if this may just be part of the process of getting into longer distance riding and getting my booty used to riding again (took about a year or two off).

gravelcycling,g4du69,Hey Reddit! Im building my first bike and I need help with my drivetrain.," 

As the title suggests, I am going to build my first do it all-road/gravel/adventure bike.

The frame will be an All-City Space Horse (56cm). My LBS in an authorized All-City dealer so that's pretty great. We have the rest of the components figured out so no need to worry there.

I basically want a 1x groupset with hydraulic discs at $900 or less. I am currently looking at a Sram Rival 1 with an 11-42t and a 42t chainring (GXP BB) with hydraulic disc brakes. It comes to $920 for everything on Jenson. (I live in the US btw).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, here's my problem.

Can I get the same components cheaper somewhere else than Jenson in the US?

Although I have tried and prefer Sram's double-tap, I am willing to take a look at Shimano's GRX if I can get the same setup for the same price or less(1x, hydro, 68mm BB)? - Spec me some parts on that if you can.

(I've had a difficult time doing this because on Jenson at least, it's hard to get the shifter and brake calipers with the right setup (left brake lever is the front brake in the US, not willing to switch.)

That's pretty much it. Thank you for your help Reddit!"

Thanks for shedding light on my ignorance!"
gravelcycling,g2jkn1,1x Setup Questions," Hello, I asked this over on /r/bikepacking but did not get much response. I have a bone stock 2020 Kona Rove ST which I love. It has SRAM Rival 1x11 on it. The front has SRAM S series cranks with a 40t xsync chainring. The rear has the stock 11-42 Cassette and as mentioned, Rival derailleur. It has a Rival shifter as well.

Anyway, I think the low end is a bit too high for loaded gravel touring in the mountains. This gives me 96.5 gi in the high end and 25.2 gi in the low end. I am considering some ways to lower the low end and it seems like there are a few options:

* Throw a 38t road x-sync chainring on it which is roughly $70 and would change the gear inches to: 91/23 gi. Would this hold up to off-road use?
* Put a 36t or 38t Wolftooth 110 BCD Gravel / CX / Road Chainring (I think this works with my cranks not sure though) which would be $80. Gear inches would be 86/22 in 36t which I think might be an issue at the top end spinning out. Though loaded bikepacking off road might not be an issue. Can anyone confirm that this chainring would work with my cranks though?
* Convert to the Wolftooth CAMO chainring system for around $100. Same gi as above with 38 but more adaptable I think as you can easily swap down lower if you knew a trip was steep? Not sure what spider or ring I would need so help there would be awesome.
* Just put a Sunrace CSMX8 11-46T cassette on it. It seems that this works right out of the box with Rival according to Pathlesspedaled ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRx4HcmHBXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRx4HcmHBXE)) This would be about $80 plus labor (I don't have enough skill / never replace a cassette before) and put gear inches at 96.5/23 gi. This is decently cheap but heavy and I am not sure it really extends the range enough to be noticeable.
* Going all the way and getting a 10-48 Garburuk Cassette and long cage. This would be $400 but the gear inches would be 106/22 gi which seems amazing. According to Pathlesspedaled ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jFzCwjlH4E&amp;t=678s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jFzCwjlH4E&amp;t=678s) ) this works really well. Obviously the most expensive option but seems to save weight and improve both the top and bottom end of the 1x setup.

Am I missing any other options? Am I missing any compatibility issues with these ideas? I am not super experienced with modern bikes and especially not road/cx setups so I am learning. What are your thoughts?"
gravelcycling,g2j62w,What's the consensus around here on Titanium vs Carbon frames?,"I've ridden plenty of carbon and alu frame but never a Ti frame, wondering if I would really be able to feel a difference there.  


Also worth noting the differences between cheaper and more expensive carbon/ Ti frames if any of you has that experience."
gravelcycling,g2i39v,Could use some of your collective wisdom on flared drop bars.,"I'm in the market for a new bar for my Renegade, which spends time on road, gravel, and mixed rides. The stock Ritchey Evomax isn't exactly cutting it for me. The classic bend has a few positions that are just passable, but certainly not ideal. For road bikes, I eventually landed on the Cinelli Neo Morphe, which is near ergonomic perfection. But I can't bring myself to spend that much money on a bar that I'm sure will see a bit of abuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main priorities are having a comfortable and easy reach to the levers from the hook section of the drop and a comfortable transition into the hoods from the top, although I do appreciate having a nice position near the end of the drops for cruising. I've been looking at the Ritchey Venturemax 46cm, but I'm a little concerned about the super shallow drop, the PNW Coast 48cm, Spank Flare 25, Pro Discover Gravel, Salsa Cowchipper/Whisky #7, and am open to any suggestions. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what are your thoughts/likes/dislikes?"

Love the specs but don’t know anyone who has one and there’s not much I can find for reviews.
Not at LBS but it would ship to my house and I can put it together. 

2. Salsa Journeyman 650b Sora build 

https://salsacycles.com/bikes/journeyman_650b/2019_journeyman_sora_650

Like that the 650b is the initial spec. Know lots of people that have them and love them. Can get one from my small town LBS for 1099. Also can’t decide between purple or blue. I’m thinking purple.

3. I also like the giant revolt 2 but have no where to get one."
gravelcycling,g1xwk8,Specialized Diverge Gravel Wheelset?,"I have a 2019 diverge e5 comp, that I really want to be my everything bike as I live in an apartment and don’t have room for more bikes :( it currently has the stock wheelset with the stock 30mm tires, but I was thinking of maybe getting another wheelset that I can swap over for when I want to do a gravel ride. I still like to go for long road rides, and use my bike for a bit of bike packing, so I don’t want to completely swap over. 
Is getting a second wheelset worth it? Worth going to 650? Specialized says the diverge will fit a 47 on a 650. Too wide for the occasional gravel ride?"
gravelcycling,g1xdsr,A Silver Lining - Upping my Route-Planning Game,"With group rides and races out for the season, I've discovered something about myself.  I've been a follower.  When it comes to gravel, I tend to either show up for the group ride and follow other people, or I just do the same couple training loops over and over.  Well, it turns out that the same loops get pretty old after a while, so lately I've been putting a lot of effort into creating some new routes for myself and I thought I'd share a few things I've learned. 

First, I'm an unabashed fanboy for [Caltopo.](https://caltopo.com/) I've used it for years planning backpacking trips, but rarely bothered for local cycling until recently.  The ability to switch between map layers is huge.  I'll use google street maps or open cycle maps just to get started, but then at times switch to satellite view.  This is helpful for figuring out if a road is gravel or paved, or if it's tree covered or exposed.  Then I'll look at google terrain or other layers that show landscape contours so I can find all the good climbs (it's Kansas, you have to look for them). Occasionally, satellite view will reveal that a road isn't really there anymore also, so always good to check.   

It's very easy in Caltopo to draw lines, so I'll usually rough in a section of the route, then look at its elevation profile and the satellite view and make changes as necessary.  Once happy with a route in Caltopo, just click export, choose GPX and select the line you want to include.  Then you can import that GPX file into ""Courses"" in Garmin Connect.  There, you can also rename the file and make other changes and of course export  to your device.  Weirdly, you can't use the desktop browser version to push the course to device over WiFi, but you can from the mobile app.

When I'm out on the ride, sometimes I'll use the Garmin lap button to highlight a section of road that is particularly cool. Lap it once at the start of a cool stretch and again at the end.  Later I can use these ""highlights"" to improve my routes.

Still trying to figure out a few things.  For one, markers on a Caltopo map don't seem to import to Garmin Connect. This would nice for POI on the ride.  You can add them in connect after importing from Caltopo, but I'd prefer to do everything in one place.  Another thing I haven't yet tried is setting alternate/bail-out points on the map.  

Anyway, a few things I've had luck with, I would love to hear tips and tricks from others."
gravelcycling,g1unrs,Can't decide on my first gravel bike...help!,"I'm looking at a few bikes right now in a few different configurations:

* Cannondale Topstone
* Jamis Expat
* Salsa Journeyman
* Kona Rove NRB

I can't decide if I want to spend 1000 and get a Sora build, or drop 2k and get hydraulic brakes and 1x setup.

I'm going to be riding this 80% on roads/commuting. 20% off-road on mountain dirt roads (live in Front Range, CO) and maybe a couple bikepacking trips/year with the girlfriend.

I currently own a Commencal Meta TR 29er MTB and a Schwinn Madison single speed. I'm missing out on gears for city rides, and moving to Salt Lake City soon where I'll need to bike commute to work most days (no free parking at the new job!).

Can someone decide for me??? I'm willing to drop $2k on a bike if it's defiently worth it. But if I can get away with a Sora groupset and cable disc brakes then cool, I'll do it. But I just can't decide!

gravelcycling,g1tw6u,GRX confusion going 2x with 11-42,"I'm confused by incomplete/conflicting information online about Shimano GRX rear mech which I want to add to my current 2x Tiagra 4700 setup. I'm asking here first because I know that Shimano gives conservative numbers for their low sprocket max for derailleurs. I'm planning to put on the 810 or 812 rear mech on since the pull ratio is the same for the 10 speed 4700 shifters and I plan to upgrade to 105 hydro down the line.

**What I want to do is get a 11-42 cassette** on, **but keep it 2x**, is this possible with the 810? Shimano claims 11-34 as max for the 810, but that's the same max for the Tiagra 4700 (and I thought GRX was supposed to give wider gearing)?

If 11-34 is a hard-max range for the 810, has anyone had luck with running an 11-42 or 11-40 with it using a Wolf Tooth road link? Is 1x a hard limitation with the 812 rear mech or can it go 11-42 on a 2x as well?

I'm trying to avoid the TanPan and XT derailleur route for the sake of simplicity.

I never ever have had any problems with chainlines even with sketchy builds.
It originally had ultegra 11spd cassette with somesort of spacer between spoke end of freewheel and cassette. But I doubt this will solve any issues. Now it has 11spd sunrace cassette.

I'd hoped to run 32-35mm tyres on the 700c build and 47-52mm (the maximum the tripster can accommodate) on the 650b. Now the 650b wheelset must be able to accommodate both of these for mixed terrain use.

Already decided I'll use hope hubs and 32 spokes. Weight is not the main criteria (I'm 105kg-230 to my American friends) so a few grand won't make much difference. Tubular compatible at least.

I'm new here and somewhat new to bicycles. Yeah, I've riden all my life but never had anything ""properly thought"" regarding bicycles. I've bought my last bike around 10 years ago and it was a Vanmoof OTT - terrible bike.

Now I'm moving to a new job location that is closer to my home, so I'm thinking about riding a bike more often. I'm not talking about a long distance: I'd say in work days something like 10-15 Km. On leisure days more.

&amp;#x200B;

I love the idea of a gravel bike but if I were to ride with friends who have a designated road bike, how would a gravel bike hold up on normal roads in comparison?

gravelcycling,fxxvhv,Aero Bars: Mini or Full Size?,"Hi all, its looking like I wont be doing any sort of gravel event until September at the earliest and its got me thinking about changes to the way I ride on gravel.

Specifically, I had not planned on running aero bars at any point this year because I didn't feel like I had the time to get the fit dialed in and outside of DK didnt feel like I had much use for them. But, now that I have the time, i am reconsidering and wondering if folks had thoughts on the selection of mini vs. full size bars and regular clip-ons vs. ""modular"" systems like the Vision MAS or Enve system specifically for use on gravel.

I would frequently be removing the bars for shorter rides (&lt;150mi), any sort of group / charity ride, and outside of DK all of the events I have planned.

Thoughts appreciated. Thanks!"

gravelcycling,fxap9q,Need help deciding on first gravel bike!,"Hi! I'm in the market for a new gravel bike and was set on a 2020 Cannondale Topstone AL 105 for $1250 (planning to spend ~$550 upgrading to a Cannondale SAVE carbon seatpost and set of Hunt 4 Season wheels). Since I had been pestering my LBS for a bike with a GRX groupset, the shop offered me a 2020 Scott Addict Gravel 30 that comes with a GRX 11s RX600 groupset at a discount ($2400 from $3000).

Topstone: https://www.cannondale.com/en-us/bikes/road/gravel/topstone-alloy/topstone-105?sku=c15700m10xs

Addict: https://www.scott-sports.com/us/en/product/scott-addict-gravel-30-bike

My gut tells me to save the difference (around $750) and stick with the Cannondale and that I'm being a diva when it comes to the GRX groupset since 105 is solid and the stock FSA isn't THAT bad, but what would you all recommend? Also, I think max tire width on the Scott is 40c, which is likely fine, but something to keep in mind if I want to do more aggressive off-road riding.

gravelcycling,fx9xpn,Next bike purchase? Gravel/road?,"Hey guys! First year cyclist here.  I bought a Trek Al Domane 2 (lowest end Trek road bike built for comfort, Claris components) this year and have been loving it; I am getting 200-300 miles a week on it.  I also bought a 20 year old cyclocross bike that I take into the gravel roads in the mountains with nice 35mm knobby tires.

I plan to buy a new bike soon but just want a do it all bike with upgraded components and disc brakes, but something I can put on my road bike tires for some group rides but also put on 40mm tires for my weekend rides in the gravel mountain roads (I def. want more grip).

If I buy a gravel bike like the Trek Checkpoint ALR5 or Canyon Grail and I'm thinking this would be a big upgrade from my Trek AL Domane 2 (in terms of components) and allow me to be just as fast on the road (with road bike tires) but also but on 40mm tires on the weekends. It seems like these bikes weigh just as much (or are lighter) than the Domane I have currently, but also better components.  I'm not terribly worried about speed (I won't be buying carbon components anytime soon), but I don't want to sacrifice too much on the road either.  I do enjoy a good fast cycle here and there and race from time to time.  Is this a good strategy for my next bike purchase?"

gravelcycling,fwjb4j,Two wheelsets.,"So I recently got a GT grade and I'm wondering how two wheels sets work. I do/did have a road bike with gp4000 sii but I am looking to sell it and use the GT grade for road and gravel. I am thinking about running gp5000 32mm on the grade for road use. At the moment I have wtb Riddler's 37mm for gravel which I am happy with. My current options are switch tyres when I want to do long milage road/have friends that have road bikes or stick with the Riddler's at a higher psi.

The other more expensive path is to buy a new wheelset and fit the gp5000 to them.. and possibly go tubeless on both. However, how does this work with cassettes, won't the chain wear to fit one cassette more than the other? if the cassettes are different I would have to re adjust the rear derailleur every wheel swap? Do you just remove the cassette and move it over to the new wheel set everytime you switch, could this cause issues with thread wear? I was hoping just to remove the axel and pop the wheelset on , but the more I think about it there could be some potential issues."

gravelcycling,fw5piq,Fast Rolling Tires for 80/20 Road to Gravel? G-One vs Byway vs Riddler vs GK Slick,"Hey guys! Sorry for another what tire thread, but I am tearing my hair out (my wife calls it ""analysis paralysis"" and she isn't wrong) and could really use some insight from people with more experience. 

I just picked up a 2019 Topstone 105 and while I really love the bike, I'm not super crazy about the stock WTB Nanos. I did a bit of a mixed surface ride yesterday and while they did really well with gravel grinding and a bit of dry doubletrack, their rolling resistance on hard pack and tarmac didn't exactly impress me. 

I'd love to go on epic gravel rides everyday, but If I am being realistic a large portion of my riding with this bike will be on hard surfaces including bike trails. Since the Nanos are a bit of a sludge fest I would really like to change them out for something quicker rolling, but still capable when need be. I'm shooting for something in the 35-40mm range with tan sidewalls. After way too much research I came away with these option:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Schwalbe G-one Allround** (700x35/38c): I had this tire in 35mm on my last bike. I  didn't put a ton of miles on them, but they were comfortable and rolled fast. From the bit of research that I have done it looks like they come in a couple of different compounds and two ranges (Evo and Performance) so it is hard to know exactly what tire people are talking about in reviews and long term reports. While they did roll fast and were comfortable, I have read enough reports of short tread life and poor puncture protection for me to hesitate. 
* **WTB Byway** (700x40c): I can find a lot of reviews of the older 650b version, but there doesn't appear to be much out there about the 700's yet. On the surface they seem to be a good compromise for the conditions I am riding in. I'm a little concerned about the weight and how tall the sidewall tread is, but so far they are the probably the front runner. 
* **WTB Riddler** (700x37c): I test road a 2020 Topstone with these and from memory they did feel faster the Nanos on my bike. They are marketed as a fast rolling, mixed terrain tire, but so are the Nanos. I worry that they wouldn't be enough of a change to warrant the change. 
* **GravelKing Slicks** (700x38c): These seem to be overshadowed by the SK models. I have read a few reports of poor puncture resistance, but besides that they seem like an ok option. 

Do any of you guys have experience with any of these options?

Thanks!"
gravelcycling,fw37bq,Opinions on Cervelo Aspero?,"Riding gravel currently on an all steel All City Mr Pink riding on 28’s. It’s been a great riding frame for road, trail and most of the gravel I ride. 

However, a new gravel road has just opened nearby and it has sections that are chunky enough that my bike can get sketchy unless I really slow down, and I’m considering something with longer chainstays, wider clearance and discs. 

What I like about the Aspero is; better clearance, aero gravel frame, flexible enough for gravel and road...some pretty colors 🥳

I don’t plan to use it for bikepacking and won’t mount anything beyond either a seat or feedbag. 

Oh, also not fussed about brand name/image/infamy.

So, anyone have this bike and care to share an opinion and perhaps a comparison to another bike you’ve used for gravel especially over a bit of prevalent sized chunk?"

This got me thinking about asking the small dedicated community here about their own experiences with this. Obviously we all know by now about [BikePacking's](https://bikepacking.com/index/gravel-bars/) extensive list of bars, but it never gets into the fit side of things; never mind the aspect of hood variances.

What has been y'all experience with bar shopping &amp; swapping?

My piece to add: I have two bikes, each with 46cm Cowchippers on them but one has Sram Force1 hoods and the other has Shimano 105. What I've found personally is the bars fit and feel completely different simply because of the hoods. The Force1 hoods have a shorter, steeper angled hood which is forcing a totally different hand grip over the Shimano. This is now getting me to consider a longer reach bar to compensate for this."

gravelcycling,fq4960,"Discussion: No. of engagement points in hub system, for Gravel application","Hey Reddit. Wondering if you guys had any input or experience to share regarding the number of engagement points in your hub system, specifically for Gravel riding. Case in point: I have a pair of DT Swiss wheels that I dearly love, however it’s been brought to my attention that upgrading the stock 18 tooth ratchet system towards 36 or even 54 tooth would be fairly easy and relatively unexpensive. 

On one hand, all over the Tube and Google you can find mountain biker reviewers praising the upgrade for its benefits for riding technical sections and tech uphills in MTB application specifically (plus: there’s the nice touch of a killer sound). On the other hand, you also find the occasional « Adds some drag, roadies beware » comment.

After breaking my old fork, I was advised by the company that made the bike (who shall at this stage remain unnamed) that they couldn’t get me a new fork but if I needed one I’d need to get - 1 1/8"" - 1 1/4"".

So I spend a heap of time researching and found a sweet Richie fork. Cost quite a bit of money... and time.  

So the fork turns up and I took it to a guy to install and he has said I actually need a 1 1/8"" - 1 1/2"" fork! - so I go back to the company and they say oh yeah you actually need that one (grrr).

So, first question - is there I can do? Ie is there an adapter or something? 

Thank you!"

I recently upgraded from a 44cm 10° flare to a 48cm 20° flare handlebar and it has affected my fit quite a lot.

The only option that I've come up with is to reduce my 70mm 7° stem to a 50mm 7° stem in order to bring the bar a bit closer to me. Now I am concerned at whether it will affect the handling/steering quite heavily (mostly when going downhill on nice fast descents)?

Has anyone experience with a stem being too short?"

gravelcycling,fpa9d6,Potentially unpopular opinion: Gravelkings are meh tires,"The SKs in 38 were my first gravel-specific tires and I’ve used them for multiple thousands of mile across three different framesets and they’ve still got life in them yet. But I don’t find that they ride that great... I found that I have to drop the pressure significantly (set up tubeless I usually end up at mid/high 20s front, mid/low thirties back at 180ish lbs) to stop them from feeling stiff and bouncy, but then they feel slow and draggy. 

They’re certainly hard-wearing, durable tires and a solid all-rounder, no argument there. But I’ve found them to be generally uninspiring.

Anyone had similar experiences? 

Also, the color options are terrible, imo."

gravelcycling,fosp3p,Another tire question... sorry newbie here :),"Hello there! So I am finally narrowing down my choice for my first gravel bike, but I want to make sure it is one I can tinker with and have future options and little upgrades for it. I like working on my own bikes :)

I think I am either going with a Kona Sutra or Rove ST, but I am trying to settle on tire size preference. I finally figured out that 700C is the same than 29 (sorry I have never owned or ridden a road bike, just mtb), and 650 is 27.5. 

I am leaning towards 700c just because it is what I am used to, but I was wondering if you could add more substantial tires to a  WTB KOM Light i25 TCS 700c rim. I have a set of Maxxis Rekon Race 2.25 that I used on my old hard tail when riding gravel, but I am not sure if I can swap these on the Rim that comes with the Sutra (WTB). I have googled this more than people have googled COVID-19 and can't find an answer, not even if it was to save my life... The tires that come with the Sutra are  700x50c, and it seems it will be ok if you look at this chart, but can't be 100% sure

[https://www.wtb.com/pages/tire-rim-fit-chart](https://www.wtb.com/pages/tire-rim-fit-chart)

I guess my main question is how big (thick) of a 29er can I but on the RIM that comes with the Sutra (WTB KOM Light i25 TCS 700c)? I am not a gentle creature and my vision is questionable, so holes, rocks and what not sometimes some out of nowhere LOL"

gravelcycling,fnmdug,Question on Tire Replacement,"Hi folks,

I have a quick question about replacing tires. In a few days, I'll have a new Trek Checkpoint ALR5 arriving. The bike comes with stock 40mm GR1 Comp Tires I think, which won't be bad for gravel riding. But for road riding, I wanted something a bit slimmer so I ordered some 32mm Panaracer GravelKing SKs. Would it be bad to frequently swap out these tires depending on the riding conditions? It's unclear to me if consistently changing tires is bad for the tubes or wheels. 

Sorry if this is an elementary sort of question but anything helps!"

Looking for a one bike to do all as much as possible. UK based, riding mix would be 20-30%  road, 30% CX racing (not podium), the rest gravel.

Currently have an Orbea Terra which is my CX rig plus can do gravel. Sram Rival 1 hydro groupset, 36 chainring and 11-36 out back 

I’ve got various wheel sets for road/gravel/CX so my question is more about frame and components/drivetrain.

Frame options - keep the terra and upgrade, trek checkpoint, open up, Specialized diverge (bleurgh), what else has a balance of endurance geometry?

Gearing - ideally DI2, fed up with SRAM. Thinking Ultegra DI2 brifters, Sub compact chainset (46/30?), ultegra DI2 front mech, XTR DI2 rear mech with 11-40 cassette???

Or some sort of GRX setup?

Thoughts appreciated - I know it’s always a unicorn, but what have you built that comes close to the above?

Thanks

gravelcycling,fmipbt,Thinking of switching from Diverge to Roubaix,"I've seen this discussed before, but figured I would check and see if anyone else has done the same and regretted it.

I picked up a 105 Aluminum Diverge last fall and upgraded the wheels. It's a great bike, although a bit heavy and sluggish. I don't love the progressive futureshock and would like the option to lock it out, to save some weight, and have a slightly (very) more road-oriented geometry.

I ride mostly on a smooth surface towpath in central NJ and increasingly on the road (after many years on the road, I switched to mtb  and am now making my way back). Currently running 700x30 tires, so no deep gravel. I know the Roubaix can still accommodate a wider tire, though not much more. 

I guess there is the longer term possibility that I would need more aggressive tires, but I always tend to overthink these kinds of things -- hanging up on the 5% chance I might need something not available to me down the road like more tire clearance. Fire roads, dirt roads, rough roads, regular roads, towpath surfaces will almost certainly be 95% of my riding. 

So, I feel comfortable that the Roubaix is appropriate for all of this. But has anyone approached this the same way and regretted it?

I just recently received my Canyon Grail AL 7.0 and it's amazing! Prior to that bike I've been riding my 10 years old Lapierre MTB and the gains in speed on flat surface are incredible.  


Since I am changing from a MTB, I was wondering how much force I can put on the Gravel wheelset. The new Gravel Bike came with the ""DT Swiss C 1850 spline"" wheelset. Weirdly though, I cannot find any official information about this wheelset at all. The official DT Swiss website only lists their ""C 1800 spline"" set ([https://www.dtswiss.com/de/produkte/laufraeder-strasse/cross-road/c-1800-spline/](https://www.dtswiss.com/de/produkte/laufraeder-strasse/cross-road/c-1800-spline/)).

Some of them are totally unused, some are still part of active logging operations, and some parts of the network have been totally reclaimed by nature. I'll usually use Ride with GPS to plan my routes, but it's not perfect. Sometimes I route myself to a road that isn't there anymore, or just get turned around the wrong way. 

I had one close call where I ended up backtracking and found my way out just as it was getting too dark to see. Luckily I had my headlight so I could still ride home once I was back on the asphalt. But, it made me realize that I had no idea what to do if I got lost, like really lost, and it got dark when I was out in the woods."

gravelcycling,fiiju9,What ruined the Mid-South 100 Gravel Race,"1) Changing the name from Land Run 100 to Mid-South. I understand a small group of people got offended about calling it Land Run, but is the name going to change again when someone decides to get offended from the name Mid-South?  The ""Mid-South"" name is used by so many different kinds of events, it doesn't stand out and isn't the slightest bit recognizable from other ""Mid-South"" races. There is the mid south race car race, motocross, running, road cycling, ect. It is a generic term.   
2) The logo sucks. Its not recognizable on what it is or what it even means to the event. The 3 hills it shows are not even close to any of the terrain and doesn't resemble any of the routes I have rode in the past. It doesn't even allude to what the event is or what it is about. When printed on a shirt it is bland and boring. Only thing on the shirt is ""Mid-South 2020"". No bike. Not mention of cycling or gravel of any kind. Nothing.

3) Swag bags. I know they are just mostly promo stuff. For such a publicized and large race, the bags this year were incredibly lame. In previous years, there was useful stuff. Tire tools,mud stick, cycling hats, vendor stickers, socks, and various vendor nick-nacks. This year, there was none of that. A couple promo fliers and a mud stick with a LOWES logo. Very disappointing. Especially for the hype and cost of the event. 

4) Why the hell were there ZERO stickers? Seriously, in previous years, we could count on a LR100 sticker. Ive been loaded up with stickers from vendors. Granted, I have a stack of stickers I will never use, but I really loved the LR100 stickers and had a nice collection on my car. Had a nice collection going from all the races I have attended. For some reason, smaller races have no problem with this, but one of the largest races like this dropped the ball.   


5) Vendor Booths are...well.....Blah... This is kinda understandable though given the circumstances. Hopefully they will be better after the race, they usually are. Just seem lacking more this year than previous. This point is moot considering the virus. I totally understand if vendors don't want to come out and play in the rain and viral downpours however. I'm just not sure if this is attributed to the virus or event.    


I can deal with the fact that the event is different than anticipated due to the virus going around and the rain that decided to pop up this last night/this morning. It just seems to me that the focus changed from having a fun event focused on the riders, to an event focused on making money and bringing in profit. This event has previously always been my favorite. It was 3 hours away, and the event I loved everything about in previous years. It just seems the quality and care have slacked off a lot this year.   
That said, its about ready to kick off after the rain delay. It has been so much of a disappointment this year, I may not sign up again. Hopefully something can be done for next year to improve it.   


I'm interested in other opinions. Race is starting. Wish me luck, got to go."

I’m looking for a gravel bike that I can use for gravel racing (signed up for Gravel Worlds this year) and group rides around 4K (US). I live in Nebraska where there is a surplus of gravel roads (and cows). I really want to get a gravel rig that can be used for the various gravel races and rides around here, and having some bike packing capability would be ideal as well. A few that I’ve looked at/ridden so far:

Trek Checkpoint SL6: love the look and ability to race gravel plus do a bit of bike packing. 

Cannondale Topstone: rode for the first time today. Felt really smooth (albeit while riding in a parking lot)

Salsa Warbird GRX 810: haven’t ridden yet, but have always heard great things about Warbirds


Any other suggestions or thoughts?? Thanks!"

On the downhill, I feel soreness and minor pain in the rotator cuff, even if I'm off the saddle and everything is bent to reduce shock.

At this point, I'd still wish for an Ariel Atom (Nomad would be the ""gravel"" version) or Lotus (low weight improves everything) with a K20/24, but I will end up getting EVs, starting with a car, but would like a e-bike, scooter, motorcycle, etc. Also really want a Hamboard."

gravelcycling,fgabcb,"What kind of Specialized saddle for Gravel? Power, Power Arc, Phenom,...?","Hi,

I do have a Gravel Bike (Canyon Grail CF SL) and need another saddle, as the Fizik doesn't fit at all.

I'm looking for an other saddle and really like the concept of the Specialized range.

I'm a little unsure which one to choose? 

When I compare the saddles and read the marketing-statements from Specialized it looks like, that the original Power-Saddle is more for race-conditions and a stretched/lean forward position on the bike (and much time in the drops).  
The Power-Arc isn't qualified at all and the Phenom is more a MTB saddle than a Road saddle...

And if I look at the Specialized Gravel Bikes all of them do have the Power Saddle (without Arc)

Which one would you choose?"
gravelcycling,fg6aso,What are the benefits of 650B?,My bike will clear a 700x51 tire. Is the main reason I see 650B on so many gravel rigs because many bikes will only clear a 700x40-42 and will clear a 650Bx47-50ish tire? Or are there more reasons?
gravelcycling,fg49me,rode on some gravel and ...,"... well riding on gravel, literally, is not so enjoyable, I must say. Have done it as a kid and it was the same.

gravelcycling,fehgs9,Adidas Five Ten Kestrel - is it good a good shoe for gravel?,"I would like to try clipless for the first time, I have no experience whatsoever.

I bike mostly into the forest a mix of gravel and mud, plus a 10 km stretch on asphalt to get there. It's mostly cold, wet and windy: welcome to Copenhagen, Denmark :) 

I thought of the Five Ten Kestrel Laced as a good beginner shoe which is:

* clipless compatible
* can run  flats if needed (I run Crankbrothers Double Shot 3, which are both flats and clipless)
* somewhat water resistant and warm
* good for gravel/mud
* can be used for walking if needed
* good for wide feet

Now I received the shoe and I am having second thoughts: I have a tendency to buy stuff which is too heavy, too large, too bulky, and I am afraid it is the case with this shoe too, which seems pretty heavy duty compared to what I do, and much stiffer than I thought.

I would like to ask  whether other people who bike in the forest, gravel/xc style and a bit of asphalt use this shoe too, or is this too heavy/MTB specific for my needs?

In case your feedback is negative, could you recommend a shoe which matches my countless needs? I am willing to give up on the walkability aspect if necessary.

Thanks in advance."
gravelcycling,fehasb,Flare angle vs bar width,"I currently run 44cm specialized hover bars with 12 degree flare. 

I’d like a wee bit more control when descending and my options at this width and rise (I need the rise to get my fit right) are:

46cm specialized with 12 degrees
44 Prime Kanza (5mm more rise) with 16 degree flare

Which bar will provide better stability? Adding 4 degrees at the same width, or keeping 12 degrees and adding 2cm to the width?

Another 5mm rise would be nice too..."
gravelcycling,fefvrm,100x15mm front thru axle?,"Looking at an Otso Warkakin Ti bike build and am curious why the MFG has gone with a 15mm front hub/thru axle rather than a 12mm thru axle? Do gravel bikes really need the thicker front axle? 

Was hoping to be able to swap wheels with my road bike on days where I just want the relaxed geometry but aren't going to touch dirt.. Simpler and faster than changing tires to slicks in my mind... Of course my road wheels are 12mm front and back...

gravelcycling,fee0fd,Advice: Grx crankset instead of Tiara one,Hey fellow gravel enthusiasts! I currently have a [Cube Nuroad Pro FE](https://www.cube.eu/2019/bikes/road/road-cyclocross/nuroad/cube-nuroad-pro-fe-greynblack-2019/) with Tiagra groupset. That is: 50-34t crankset and an 11-34t cassette. That gives me a 1 to 1 climbing ratio. On longer steeper tours I’ve found that this is not really enough for me. Does anybody know if there is a way to fit a [Grx crankset](https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/grx-10-speed/FC-RX600-10.html) 46-30t instead of the Tiagra one?

Who's got experience?,"I'm picking up a set of Aeolus 3v's soon for my Checkpoint SL5 and recently saw someone running the GRX 650b wheelset on a Checkpoint with Terraval 650b 53mm tires. It got me thinking since the GRX wheelset is so inexpensive, why not play around with 650b.

Anyone on a Checkpoint have any experience? What kind of tires and what widths did you run and with what clearance?  (Bonus points for anyone with a Checkpoint and the 700c Aeolus 3v's and common tires like the Gravelking SK's!)"
gravelcycling,fe489e,Midsouth Tires,"I'm running Gravelking Slick 38s right now because most of my riding is mixed pavement and dry gravel/dirt.  I did Hazel Valley Gran Prix in NW Arkansas a few weeks ago and didn't have any issues.  It was mostly loose, dry gravel and hard pack. I had done that ride a few weeks prior on GK slick 32's when it was a bit wetter in areas and didn't have any problems then either. 

I got a transfer in to Midsouth and am now starting to worry about how they will perform if it's muddy in the clay.  I have not taken them out in extremely wet/muddy conditions.  Anybody tried them in wet sticky clay and completely regret it?  Should I go for the SKs or would those just pack up and become slicks too?"

My arm length is the same as my height or 1 inch longer. Which size do you think would fit me best?

I live in a pretty rural area so going to a bike shop to try them both isn't really an option in the near future."

I have a 2019 Rove ST and it doesn't have a ton of clearance with 47s so I wanted something slightly narrower. There arent many choices for 650b less than 47 but I picked up a pair of 650b x 40 Terra Trails (chose these because they were on sale for 25 USD/ea.) to get some clearance and traction. Any experience with these? Being fairly new, there arent really any good reviews."

I did an event on my pro-level ‘cross bike but I see where it’s geometry is a weakness as far as high-speed descending and overall comfort but I have seen seen products for changing one’s head angle with offset bearings and the like (possibly a fork?) and this seems like a viable option to throwing down thousands on a dedicated rig.

gravelcycling,fdn1ks,higher handlebars and preferred methods?,"If you configured your handlebars a little higher, what method(s) did you use or do you prefer? 

I have short legs/long torso with slightly short arms + not great flexibility, like comfort+some performance, but don't care about max speed/max aero (really ""recreational"" without wanting to use a comfort bike as a main bike), so I've got my handlebars probably raised 1-2 inches above my seat by using a stem extender and a flipped +7 deg stem. So far quite pleased with how it worked. Checking out those riser drop bars and really tempted to get some as a next step or as an alternative. Maybe I'd use the drops occasionally on compact bars."

Loved the SL5. I'm looking for suggestions for a new gravel bike that \*secondarily\* serves as a durable commuter. Details on how I ride:

**Where**

* Half 30-80 mile gravel and single track rides (for fun and cardio, occasional rookie racer and bike packer)
* Half commuting around a big city (parking bike on public racks, use heli tape to protect frame currently)

**How often**

* 30-100 miles per week

**What I care about**

* \#1 kick ass gravel bike
* \#2 durability around the city
* \#3 comfort (mostly a product of contact points, tires and a good fitting)

**What I don't care about**

* I liked the 50/34 crank /11-34 cassette gearing, but don't feel strongly about keeping 2x up front if I have similar high gears (I live in Texas - relatively flat)
* 700c vs 650b; I know there's a ton of difference but I like them both as long as I can fit 40mm tires

**Budget**

* $3k
* New or used full bike or just a frame + my old components

**Questions: what new / used bike would you recommend? Would you just buy a new frame and swap in my SL5 components or buy an entirely new bike?**"

I asked in the which bike weekly thread but didn't get any responses.

So I want to get into gravel, and I have about $1k to spend on a new bike. In looking for something worthwhile I got super overwhelmed by the ton of information out there. I did manage to find a local shop by me that has a 2019 Giant Toughride GX3 in stock for $820. I took it for a test ride and loved it, but honestly noticed that it wasn't super fast. I have heard that the Giant Revolt 2 is pretty good and I believe that he can order me one to the shop.

Ideally I would like to have one in a shop so I know that everything it setup and indexed properly. While I'm sure I could do a decent job, I don't quite trust me skills yet. I am in no way set on those two bikes, just two options that seemed solid.

Thanks a ton in advance"

gravelcycling,fbwa5d,John Cobb has some good bike fit videos if maybe no saddles are working well,"A lot of gravel bikes are coming with bars at or above the saddle, which may work great for a lot of people. But if it's hard to get a comfortable butt, John Cobb has some good bike fit videos on switching to a much lower bar height that may help.

I learned of him from the triathlon side of things, that he's a guy that knows bike fit and aero, but he's less well known on the road and gravel side. With gravel there's other considerations, like bar control on rough roads, but I just thought I'd throw it out there as something to try if the common gravel fit isn't doing it for someone.

[https://www.youtube.com/user/JohnCobbbikeguy/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/JohnCobbbikeguy/videos)

The earliest 4-5 videos on his channel are the most instructive I think, where he takes someone and does a fit on them."

The stem on.my roadie is about 1/4 inch shorter soni thought about changing it"
gravelcycling,fbtchg,[Meta] Can we have bike flair?,"Apologies if this has been discussed OR if this is something that active and I simply don't see it.

-------------

I think it would be great to have user flair that we can use for our bikes. Other subs like /r/cars have it, and it's both informative and allows for some light humor.

Is that something people here would be interested in?"
gravelcycling,fbs276,Canyon Grail between 2 sizes,"Hey guys,

so I decided to buy a Canyon Grail but I'm right now stuck between 2 sizes either M or L. I'm 185cm high and have a inside leg length of 90cm with longer arms. Canyon says I should choose L but if I go just 1cm lower on my heigh I get M, so I'm right bewteen 2 sizes.

If I want a more upright and comfy position should I choose L or M? The reach on the Grail seems kinda high, so I don't now if that is a good thing or bad."

gravelcycling,fbgsks,Thoughts on Mullet builds?,"My drive train is about to need replaced (doing that after Mid-south Gravel aka Land Run) and I’ve been thinking about taking a big step up to an axs Mullet build (https://www.sram.com/en/life/stories/the-mullet-bike)

Anyone here have experience with a build like this? Any thoughts?

For some context: I do about 3500 miles a year on this bike and go to 3-7 events a year on it, mainly 100+ mile endurance races. I’m 6’6” and 230 lbs so I’m not so much concerned about component weight. I’m more looking for a larger gear range to climb more efficiently while also taking advantage of my weight to bomb down rollers more quickly (I currently spin out very frequently) without moving to a 2x setup."
gravelcycling,fbf98f,"Exploring Gravel in Los Animas County, CO","Took a small crew down to Trinidad, Colorado for a photo shoot for the company I work for the past two days to scope out some incredible gravel roads. This place has a ridiculous amount of potential with plains, mesas, thickly wooded areas to desolate expanses. I moved to Colorado a few years ago and continue to be amazed with the amount of variable terrain and interesting history.

gravelcycling,fb1fjb,Need help cutting weight on my 2019 Diverge Carbon Comp,"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/womens-diverge-comp/p/154315

This is the exact model I have and it's currently around 9kg.  

It's a wonderful bike but I'm struggling a bit getting up some longer climbs and now I want them MARGINAL GAINS.  I've considered changing the wheelset but after some googling I found that the DT R470s on there only weigh 1.7kg, not sure if upgrading to a carbon disc would really be worth it since it would be $600+ to save 2-300 grams. 

I'm thinking of moving from the 38c sawtooth to 32c gravelkings which will save me about 400 grams.  

Possibly replacing the stem and handlebar setup but that would only save me 100 grams.  Another thought is changing the saddle to something lighter weight as well. 

Any other suggestions to cut weight?"
gravelcycling,fap3n1,/r/gravelcycling news for March 2020,"Hey guys!

I wanted to give everyone a little update of the behind the scenes for the sub for the upcoming month. As you no doubt have noticed, we have a bot (/u/gravelcyclingbot) that's super helpful to figure out upcoming gravel events. Right now he's only able to update a sticky, but I've been hard at work on the little guy, and I'm excited to announce a bunch of new features for him! Plus, we now have a companion app!

#*BIKE COMPARISONS*
/u/gravelcyclingbot can now compare 2 bicycles! It's pretty simple to get it to work; simply preface your comment with
 
    !compare BIKE1 : BIKE2

and after a short duration the bot will attempt to look up the bike you had in mind and give a detailed list of specs.

Please note that I'm not aware of anywhere that has a bike specs database so I've had to build this thing from scratch, and with that in mind there are BOUND to be problems with some of the data in there. The second limitation is that it's rather difficult to pull a bunch of data about a lot of different things and keep it all organized, so for right now this feature only works for 2020 models for Trek, Giant, and Liv brand bicycles. Don't worry, more are coming soon!

I'll give an example of /u/gravelcyclingbot at work below.

#*COMPANION APP*
We also now have a companion app! This is the basis for the monthly sticky for gravel cycling events. You can check it out [here](http://www.graveltracker.com/)! You're able to browse gravel events all around the world by date, and even submit new ones if yours isn't already on the site. If you're interested, you can also check on the status of the bot.

For now, I'm manually approving any user-submitted events, and depending on how much work that is, I may consider allowing some other motivated users to take on some of that workflow. We'll have to see.

#*MORE SOON*
You'll continue to see the monthly events discussion, weekly bikes discussion, and more. As always, I'm more than happy for any suggestions for things you'd like to see in the future! Your feedback helps me make /r/gravelcycling better!

gravelcycling,faoxi9,Any gravel rides around Las Vegas?,"I’ll be climbing in Red Rock for a couple weeks in March and am looking to get out for a couple rides on the days “off”. Any riding to be had? I’ve tried my best to find stuff online, but didn’t find much surprisingly. Any info is much appreciated!"
gravelcycling,faorsn,GPS for gravel- Wahoo vs. 830?,"Looking to blow my REI dividend + 20% next month on a GPS/computer. Been wanting one for a while, my last cycle computer was a Shimano Flightdeck, so I'm out of touch in the arena. Plenty tech savvy, but I have no relevant experience with these things. 

TBH probably 90% of my use would be speed/cadence/HR, maybe altitude. I have a Wahoo Blue SC speed/cadence sensor ready to go, and a Tickr Fit. The ability to see texts is cool, not mandatory, I think all 3 do all that anyway. So far I'm thinking Bolt.

But then... so far I haven't done much 'exploring' riding, and there's not much on gravel anywhere I'm familiar with. I'd like to get more into that rather than my usual 'go smash out miles on the rail trail' and I wouldn't mind having decent turn-by-turn. Everything I've been seeing says the Bolt is pretty limited in that area. So I wouldn't mind the Roam either for better mapping, and hey, even a few colors sounds better than B&amp;W. I'd also probably put my phone into super-duper-power-saver for a ride more than a couple hours (battery life is pretty crap when using GPS/BT/data) for whatever that matters. I know both Wahoo units 'rely on' being connected to the companion app... but I'm not sure for exactly what? Like, if my phone is off/no BT, are either/both just full derp, like they're little more than an extended display for my phone when it comes to GPS? Or do I just need to use the app for entering a destination? 

Then there's the 830, which on paper &amp; in pics looks &amp; sounds much better. But then... I read reviews on Garmin (especially older series, but not excluding the 830 either) and read about how many people have/want to dump Garmin head units, for general quality issues, and glitchy software issues. I don't feel any need to do anything but turn it on &amp; have it work (once set up of course) and don't want to be dicking with connection issues when I want to use it. The $$$ doesn't bug me one way or another ($300... $400... whatever, in for a penny...) but I would be pretty displeased to blow that kind of change on crap hardware, or someone's future orphan that could be fixed with firmware but is ignored in the hopes of forcing upgrades. The fact they're on generation 4 (whole generations of units, when Wahoo is on, what, their 5th *model*?) and the reviews make me wonder. OTOH if the 830 bucks that rep, then it sounds pretty sweet.

I've read a good many reviews, but just don't know which way to lean. Bolt is sweet, but limited mapping. Roam has better GPS &amp; some colors, but the display is not so great, compared to both a real color LCD &amp; B&amp;W. Both of them are easy to set up with the app, but also somewhat tethered to my phone. Garmin has a sweet full color touchscreen, but is a Garmin. I am the lost here, and if anyone has read my hopefully not wall of text, I'm all ears to your experiences &amp; suggestions, thanks!"
gravelcycling,fahmn4,Platform or Clipless Pedals?,"So I just bought my first gravel bike, a Salsa Journeyman 650b. Previously I was riding an MTB and road bike. On the MTB I have RaceFace Chesters, and the road bike I have Shimano SPD pedals. I'm torn on which style of pedal to go with on the gravel bike. I moved the Chesters to the gravel bike for the meantime, but I know the benefits of clipless. Thoughts?"

gravelcycling,fa2zws,27.5 (rear) and 29 (front) mixed wheels on gravel bike - advice,"I have the Grail CF SL in XS that comes with 27.5 wheels and 40mm tyres. I can definitely notice the slower rolling/roll-over compared to 700c wheels and especially to my 29er MTB (but I hate the handling on my MTB, feels like a tank, and too high centre of gravity). 

Happy with the climbing, acceleration, and handling with the 27.5 and wondering if I could retain those qualities while also getting better roll-over for off-road by putting a 29/wide-rim 700c wheel on the front? There's plenty of clearance for a big wheel and big tyre in the front (not much room in the back).

Anyone else tried mixed wheels on a gravel bike? Any disadvantages or problems that might come up?"
gravelcycling,fa1atg,BB: Shimano HTII or Wheels Mfg quality differences?,"Hi dirt road cyclists,

Looking to upgrade the stock BB on my [2019 Rove ST](https://www.konaworld.com/2019/rove_st.cfm) to something that has more compatibility with other crank systems (namely RF Cinch).

Luckily the frame is 68mm BSA thread, so was relatively easy to find two quality options:

[Shimano BB-MT800](https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/deorext-m8000/BB-MT800.html) \- $22

[Wheels Mfg Threaded MTB ABEC-3 BB for 24mm Cranks (Shimano)](https://wheelsmfg.com/bottom-brackets/threaded-bb/standard-mtb-bottom-bracket-with-steel-bearings-for-24mm-cranks-shimano-black.html) \- $73

Both seem to get good reviews from the bike packing/touring community, especially for longevity and user service-able. However, the Wheels Mfg is 3X the price of the Shimano. 

Are there any major differences in quality/serviceability between the two (besides the Wheels Mfg being Made in USA for the price difference)? Which one, or other BB type, would you recommend.

Thank you, it's hard to make decisions like these behind a keyboard and I should probably go to my LBS for best advice."

gravelcycling,f9wf5n,Building a bike; groupset question,"Friend is helping me with a custom bike. Is [this groupset](https://www.merlincycles.com/en-us/sram-force-etap-axs-1x-d1-electronic-hrd-disc-road-groupset-12-speed-141393.html) appropriate? The reason I’m asking is that I’m told to also get a SRAM eagle rear derailleur, although I see a rear derailleur is already included in the groupset. Is Eagle &gt; Red for this application?

The cassette (10-50t SRAM rainbow) also looks pretty expensive. Is this because it’s the best or will other cassettes work?

I just want to educate myself before buying all these things. My knowledge is limited to road bike stuff and have no idea really about gravel."

gravelcycling,f8v7mr,Which events would you use your regular Road bike for?,I've done 3 gravel events this year and 2 of them I was super glad I had my 38mm Panaracer and the last one I was upset most everyone was on road bike with 25-30mm tires. I mean gravel could be as tame as well kept dirt roads in Connecticut or some real deal stuff out west in Kansas with golf ball sized sharp rocks. So... Would you ask around how the course is? Do you try to preview the ride? I'm just trying to see because people running endurance road bikes on 30m has a weight advantage that I wanted to get a better idea of when to use what for race purposes

After a few missteps via Craigslist and the used market, went new to keep for the long haul.

gravelcycling,f8190u,"SRAM compatibility headache: Eagle XX1 Derailleur, but what shifter?","Hey cyclists,

I am embarking on a dream-bike build, and I am trying to go for a gravel rig with some of SRAM's higher end lineups.

I know that I am going to throw in an Eagle XX1 (not AXS) derailleur alongside an e\*thirteen 9-46T cassette (this is a 1x setup), but I can't seem to find any optimal shifter setups (shifters + brakes).

So far, it doesn't seem like SRAM's road-bike levers support 12-speed shifting, and that is a deal-breaker for me since I really had my heart set on the 12-speed 511% range cassette and derailleur combo. 

Does anyone know of any drop-bar shifters that would allow me to use the Eagle derailleur and e\*thirteen cassette in a gravel oriented setup (12-speed shifters)?

Thanks!"
gravelcycling,f7vvqo,"Anyone in the Columbia, SC area?","I'll be moving to Columbia in the next month or two and I was curious what the area is like for gravel riding. Any information is appreciated, thanks!"
gravelcycling,f7g5zj,Does anyone have a recommendation for a wide clipless pedal shoe?,"I used to really enjoy riding clipless(especially in the climbs), but I've had to switch to platform pedals because my feet swell when I ride. I typically wear a shoe with a wide toebox off the bike. I found that clipless pedals were too constricting and narrow and I would start to get pain and hotspots. It seems like others must also have this issue, so I wonder if there is a shoe out there."
gravelcycling,f71jti,Gravel tires for Crossrip,"I have a Trek Crossrip that I am partial to and I can’t seem to let go of. She does fine on gravel, but after a few crashes, I am a little scared of her now. The tires I had were simply the ones that came with the bike, so I am looking to purchase some tires that might offer me a little more stability on the terrain. Any recommendations?

Honestly, I’ve been scared enough that I am considering riding my Trek Skye mountain bike instead for races. The wider tires are such a plus, but man that bike is heavy. 

Thanks in advance."
gravelcycling,f6xemw,Help: Tweaking an Ultegra Di2 bike for gravel,"So I bought a nice little bike on eBay that has an Ultegra Di2 group and want to tweak it a little for gravel riding. Crankset is 52/36 and cassette is 11-34. I run a 50/34 on my road bike, and if I put 50/34 chainrings on this bike, I'd have a 1:1 ratio (which is adequate for road riding, but I'm not sure about off road. Some of the climbs on the races I plan on doing are definitely steeper than what I ride on the road. 

I'm trying to figure out if I can put a GRX (48/31) crank on without having to change the front derailleur and if I did have to change the front derailleur, would Ultegra 8070 shifters work with a GRX front and Ultegra rear? Things start getting expensive quickly if I have to start buying new bits."

gravelcycling,f6jiot,Gravel Racing,"I'm half considering starting up a gravel race in my area (country NSW), as there aren't many around, but loads of ideal roads. But I have a few questions. 

Is there a typical season for gravel races, or just whenever it is good to ride?
What distances are typical? And what percent of this is gravel?
How many entrants would you expect?
And are any races closed to traffic, or is it more of a case of riding on very low traffic roads?"
gravelcycling,f6jbq7,Dirty South Roubaix 100km,"Anyone else doing this race in Alto Pass, IL at the beginning of March?"
gravelcycling,f6imy3,1x or 2x crankset for do-it-all gravel/road bike?,"Im looking into a bunch of models across the line, and want a gravel bike that will comfortable and speedy on roads as well as gravel (will likely be doing more road than gravel). As hilly as the Bay Area is, would any recommend a 1x crankset over 2x? I like the simplicity of 1x which is driving my consideration."

I'm looking at upgrading my wheels, but Carbon doesn't really makes sense to me from a practicality standpoint, and budget-wise.  Would something like these Hunt [4 season x-wide](https://www.huntbikewheels.cc/collections/gravel-wheels/products/hunt-4-season-gravel-disc-x-wide-wheelset) make an actual difference?  Weight might be the same or only slightly better than stock.  Better responsiveness?  If a different alloy wheel from stock would be better, are there other brands to consider?"

gravelcycling,f6e508,GRX vs SRAM,I'm looking into a gravel bike currently its the All City Cosmic Stallion Force 1 but they have a model with the GRX. Where does the GRX lie in relationship to SRAM? Is it like a mid range group-set or would you consider it a higher price point?
gravelcycling,f63y48,Shimano GRX 810 cranks and BB drag,"Maybe I've watched too many Hambini videos on Youtube on cranks spinning freely,

However I have two sets of GRX 810 cranks and both are extremely tight in Shimano bottom brackets (latest gen DA BB and the last gen DA BB).  I don't think my legs notice the drag, but it certainly feels stiff compared to previous Shimano Hollowtech cranks.

I can pull an older crank from another bike to see if it is a frame or BB problem, but looking to see if anyone else has noticed a difference, before I do."
gravelcycling,f5xbg8,"Looking for new, fast tires (gravel and tarmac, dry)","Hello, I'm looking for new gravel tires for my CX bike (used also as road bike and gravel). I use Gravelkings Mud/AC 700x35c now and there are very nice, but want something faster for spring. Will ride most of bad quality tarmac and gravel, 99% of time on dry conditions. 

Tubeless is not important for me - probably will use with tubes (really don't like mess).   
Also, I'm pretty light rider (about 70 kg / 154 lbs)

Max size is something about 700x37c (because of frame limitation). 

&amp;#x200B;

**What I already tried:**

* Gravelkings SK 700x35c - very nice, light, very fast and with great grip on gravel. Drawbacks: lack of comfort... I think this rubber is very hard. Also, they can ""catapulte"" small rocks and hit frame.
* WTB Riddler 700x37c - nice, with a lot of comfort and nice grip, but slow, also, terrible tire quality (curve when use tubes), definitely not like them
* WTB Exposure 700x34c - very, very fast and enough for gravel but also, terrible tire quality - never ever WTB
* Continental Cyclocross Speed 700x35c - very fast, very light, nice grip, but ""like paper"" - a lot of flats

&amp;#x200B;

**What I'm thinking about:**

* IRC Boken 700x36 - expensive, not light, but many people said it's very good choice... maybe worth to try?
* Continental Terra Speed 700x35c - not sure... similar to Schwalbe G-Ones, but probably more durable

&amp;#x200B;

What can you recommend?"
gravelcycling,f5whdo,Anyone ride in Five Tens?,"I'm getting my first pair of clipless shoes and I'm trying to decide between some Five Ten Kestral Pro Boa (I can get them for $100) or the Louis Garneau Gravel ii (Also $100). The LGs look more like a gravel specific shoe, while the 510s look more casual. And pros and/or cons to either choice? Or do you recommend any other 510 models?

I have tried on the LGs and they feel are comfortable. I'm just getting into gravel riding so these will be worn for probably 2-3 hours at a time on backroads."

gravelcycling,f5bd8d,Help with a question re gear range?,"Greetings. Hoping that some body with a more trained eye than myself can answer a question for me about gearing. Recently picked up a [Canyon Inflight AL SLX 5.0 RACE](https://www.canyon.com/en-us/road-bikes-us/cyclocross-bikes/inflite/inflite-al-slx-5.0-race/2100.html?dwvar_2100_pv_rahmengroesse=3XS&amp;dwvar_2100_pv_rahmenfarbe=BK%2FWH), which I intend to use for mixed terrain riding, albeit probably more pavement than turf.  Hate the saddle, but impressed with the bike. That said, I have not pushed it that hard as of yet, and my return window will be closing fairly soon.  The one meaningful concern I do have is that it that the low-end gearing may not be forgiving enough to comfortably tackle inclines (with me on it anyway). We have mostly rolling hills here, so inclines are not that extreme, but there are a lot of them.  In the event that I wanted to add more low end range to help take some of the sting out of those repeated climbs, what would my options be on that score?  

* Rear Derailleur
   * SRAM Apex 1 SGS
* Cassette
   * SRAM PG-1130 11-36 11s
* Crank
   * SRAM Apex 1 40T
* Bottom bracket
   * SRAM Pressfit GXPlls"

I've asked around in local bike shops and they have suggested putting flat bars (on the brand they carry) gravel bikes.  Does this throw off the geometry?

So with the discount they’re much closer in price, but still about $250 apart. I’m going to use it primarily for commuting but also getting it so that I can get into backpacking and longer off road rides.

I've done 6 sprint triathlons, 2 marathons, but I'm a little out of shape from being an office drone these days.

I want this to be my first of many gravel events, I loved competing in Tri's in my 20s but some injuries now make impact from running impossible. I love the target date and the training focus it forces during the lead up.

I'll be using my daily driver, a Jamis Renegade Escapade GRX build. Steel but whatever.

Right now it's a 1x @ 42t chainring x 10-42t cassette on a SRAM xdr driver body. I could maybe afford mods here but would rather not.

Wheelset is the Hunt 650b Dynamo, I want to change at least the front wheel for something racier and, obviously, without the Dynamo hub sucking watts.

Questions / thoughts:

- What wheel size / tire combo would you use? I could swing a &lt; $1k 700c wheelset but would rather replace front wheel only usesing my existing 650b wheel.

- Historical weather data shows 32 to 50 F° temp ranges. I see full leg / arm warmers with an outer warm layer, but I also see videos of amateurs saying that wasn't enough.

- Does my 42t 1x 650b limit my gearing top end too much? I've got the 10t using XDR but wonder about total gear inches and whatnot means for top speed.

- I'm a huge fan of keto for weight loss. I understand carbs for the race are recommended - anyone foresee issues with keto for loss then switching to carb metabolism a couple days before the race?

The RR 64k variant appears 80 % country tarmac, 20% easy gravel. I like my tubeless these days, they've been maintenance free for commuting over the shittiest shit, I will stay tubeless for the race. 

Watching the videos of prior years they appear to be on 700c 32 to 38mm rubber. I can't make out their tread but it doesn't look aggressive at all. Does that sound right? 

I have a zwift cave and tonight I'll pick a training plan and hop on it. I have no illusions about winning, I just want to finish and feel good doing it. 

Thanks in advance all."
gravelcycling,f45bu4,SRAM Rival Crank Install Help????,"just hit the next snag in my gravel build... the SRAM Rival 1 BB30 Crankset.  Ordered the crank to go on a Cannondale Slate, 73mm BB Shell.  The bottom of the BB shell has a big BB30 logo on the bottom.  However, installing the crank shows that the spindle is way too long.  The instructions were pretty sparse, but it does say I'll need a 13mm spacer on the drive side... but the Wolftooth link below is saying something different, I'll need a 9.1mm spacer based on the spindle length.  Measured my spindle length and it is 85mm.  The SRAM instructions mention nothing of spindle length.  When I purchased the crankset there was no option for spindle length.  Totally confused!  Anyone have the final word on what I need?

In looking around for the needed piecees I realized that I was going for a fit just like my road bike.  Is this right?  I have never really mountain biked or ""graveled"" before.  So my fit is from 13 years of road biking.  Does your road bike fit and position translate to gravel riding?  Do you want to be more upright like mountain biking?  I won't be doing much technical stuff... fireroads, pavement and the like.  I would like it to be a do it all ride... so how would I need to adjust my road fit/position to get my gravel bike dialed in?"

I am in the market for my first Gravel bike. I have an amazing local shop who I work very closely with, who is also a great friend of mine(my bike mechanic). He was the one who introduced me to “Enduro” which in my stable has led to my dream bike a Transition Sentinel 29er. After two seasons on an enduro, I am getting better, fitter and more hungrier for volume/miles rides. I live in the amazing state of Vermont, and am so ready to step into the gravel realm, and explore. 

I have a 1,500 - 2,000 dollar budget. Any help would be greatly appreciated y’all ! I’m also open to used/new to me bikes as well 🤙🤙🙏"
gravelcycling,f382xr,Giant Revolt Advanced 2 2020 tubeless tires.,"I'm a little confused about the tires that come with the Giant Revolt Advanced 2 2020. Everything I've seen written about them talk about tubeless tires. My question, which never seems to be addressed is wether the tires come setup as tubeless or if that's something I would have to do myself. It seems I'm missing something fundamental about tubeless tires that's causing the confusion."
gravelcycling,f36g7u,Carbon/alloy wheels,"Hey everyone, building up a frameset made by a new local builder for spring and I'm having a tough time deciding on a wheelset for gravel. 

I'm looking for a decent weight wheelset with a quickly engaging hub at a decent weight (sub 1750 grams). BMX background so the loud/quick to engage hubs are exactly what I want. So far what I've been looking at;

- Bontrager Aeolus Pro 3V Carbon wheelset (most money I'd want to spend at about 1600$ CAD)
- Hunt 35 Carbon disc X wide wheelset 1300$ CAD
- Hunt alloy 4 season x wide 540$ CAD
- Custom Alloy Wheels from LBS? 700-1000$ Im guessing. 

I would love some solid alloy or affordable carbon wheelset suggestions, custom or pre made. I really like the bontragers due to their hubs, no weight limit, and the warranty. Just a bit pricey when I can buy an alloy hunt set for 500$, albeit with not as nice hubs but they are the same weight as the bontragers. 

If I went with some hunt alloy wheels the savings would allow me to get a nice set carbon cranks/bars/seatpost. It'd save a little weight/add some comfort with a ritchey/canyon flex post. Just on the fence because people rave about how much of a difference a new set  of carbon wheels makes due to the rotational mass.

 What do you guys ride? Carbon parts/wheels, alloy or a mix of both?"

Thanks!"
gravelcycling,f2k6v7,Wheel Size/Tire Size?,"I'm sure this has been posted a million other times in some other capacity, but my situation is a little different. I have a custom made frame that was made by a frame builder who is no longer in business. I texted him a few days ago and asked if he knew what the clearance was on the chain stays/seat stays was, but he couldn't remember. I have a cyclocross frame with 135mm spacing in the rear, but I distinctly remember him saying that I could fit a 29 x 1.75 tire back there.   


I was wondering if there was some sort of formula that existed that calculated clearance for a 650/27.5"" tire IF a certain width of a 29""/700C tire could fit?   


I also have a Winwood Muddy Cross Carbon Disc Fork on this bike and was wondering if anyone knew what the 650b/27.5"" clearance would be? It says that a 700x44 knobby tire would fit through it.   


I'm looking at building a wheelset with 650b x 47 knobby tires to use and wanted to make sure they fit before I decided to swap forks."

Sourced some used tiagra 4700 shifters, and avid bb7 brakes. The rest is just things I had lying around for the most part.

gravelcycling,f1dvio,"What is the gravel cycling equivalent of a say, a Dura Ace c24 wheelset? (i.e. high-end, light, strong)","Hi all,

Noobie coming over from having done exclusively road riding, and now wanting to get away from cars as much as possible.

I'm speccing out a gravel bike (Topstone 105 or Norco Search Steel) and want to counter the added weight of such a setup compared to my zippy road bike. 

Therefore naturally for either of those bikes I will replace the heavy stock wheelset to the lightest, strongest, options available to me (I'm not down with stupidly expensive boutique stuff, but will spend whats required to get top shelf functionality). 

This will be a 700c wheelset, running at least 35mm but up to 50mm clinchers like Gravelkings or maxxis refuse, must be tubeless ready, I'm open to carbon rims but not carbon hubs and spokes, must be stiff, light, zippy, but take a beating because this bike is going to get run hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks all, and happy riding."

gravelcycling,f0g317,26x2-ish gravel tires,"I'm looking for recommendations on gravel tires for my rigid 26er. Size-wise I'm looking at 26x2 to 26x2.2, and I plan on running tubed. Budget is up to $50-ish per tire.

Right now my short list is the Panaracer Gravel King SK, Schwalbe Thunder Burt (these look like they're getting harder to find), and Continental Race King ProTection.

There's slim pickings for 26er tires these days, so in general I'm debating between of one of the few gravel tires available in 26"" and a fast-rolling/low-traction XC MTB tire, of which there are more to choose from in my size.

I thought I'd bring the topic up here because I haven't seen many online discussions that directly compare knobbier gravel tires to fast-rolling XC tires.

The majority of my riding is on the [Air Line State Park Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Line_State_Park_Trail) in Connecticut, which is mostly-well-maintained hard pack gravel. The rest is a combination of well-maintained dirt roads in our state forests and very minimal amounts of pavement to string the routes together. My rides typically range from 10 to 40 miles.

On the trail, my road bike's 700x28C gatorskins beat the crap out of me and get downright sketchy in the wet, and when the gators wear out I want to size them back down to a faster 25C tire for road-only riding anyways. My MTB's tires are great for comfort and grip, but the knobs are draggy on longer rides.

Do y'all have some more suggestions for a plush, fast-rolling 26er tire?"

On this episode, we are joined by Alex and Chris Howell the Race Directors of the Dirty Kitten Gravel Race. Alex has been the team manager at Vanderkitten/Entourage Racing.  The DKGR is 100% unpaved with the majority of the terrain being secluded gravel farm roads, as well as some dirt/grass double-track sections. The roads vary from smooth, groomed sections to rough, choppy, bumpy areas with the possibility of some mud if there is rain.

In addition to DKGR, Alex and Chris also run CatCamp. A multi-day cycling experience for women of all ages, disciplines, and ability levels in the Catoctin Mountain region of Maryland. Directed by Alex Forte Howell of Vanderkitten-Entourage Racing and Dirty Kitten Productions (Dirty Kitten Gravel Race), Cat Camp is designed specifically for women who are interested in road cycling with a side of gravel riding and mountain biking. This is an opportunity to ""get away"" from the hustle and bustle of daily life, spend a few days riding your bike and hang out with other kickass women.

gravelcycling,ezsfgm,What is your perfect GPS tracking setup?,"Some background: until last year I used strava for all my tracking. I have a quadlock mount for my waterproof phone and did all gps, heart rate and cadence recording there.

By the end of last year strava discontinued all support for external sensors in their in app recording.

I'm not quite sure what to do now. I need my phone with me for emergencies but can't track there anymore. A bike pc like a wahoo bolt would be nice but not well fitted for other stuff like hiking. A fitness watch would work but give not much information while riding (like speed, maps, ...) in the end I still want to track and sync everything to strava.

bike is a 2019 giant revolt with half mechanical half hydro 105. this is the biggest issue i have with the bike, it has Giants Conduct system which is this rediculous hub on the handlebars. google a picture of it, its so uneccssary. going full 105 id need to buy shifters and the 7020 (105s) and 8020(ultegra) are expensive. 

handelbar- i want an aero handlebar or at least a carbon one to replace this 300g one 

seatpost - not sure how much the sadle weights but its comfy for me compared to my road one

wheels - have replaced stock 1900g wheels with hunt gravel 1600g ones

crankset- i think this is where im losing the most power. the alu Praxis Alba just doesnt transfer as much as my road bikes ultegra carbon ones. i dont know i feel like i move much more speed per rotations on my road bike than i do on the gravel one

I was always under the impression that gravel could be a toss-up between 2x or 1x with 1x being superior for cross, MTB, and anything more technical than gravel roads.

It's one thing to see say a Kona Rove with stock 1x but the AC Cosmic Stallion? What? Unless I'm mistaken, It's essentially a road bike with gravel clearance, no? Where's the benefit of 1x there?

Scratching my head over here. Less gears, bigger gaps, and I'm not sure the benefits of 1x are optimal for gravel. Don't get me wrong, 1x definitely has its place, but part of me can't help but feel that 1x is ""in"" these days and that's why we're seeing it as opposed to it actually being the best gearing choice."

I bought a discounted Kona Libre DL 2019 with the SRAM Force 1 groupset. I love the groupset so much but have been having lots of problems with my calipers and levers. My local bike shop has suggested I change the caliper at the rear and the lever at the front as the bladder is leaking. 

Out of pure curiosity can I 'mix and match' calipers and levers? I like the look and tiny weight reduction of the Red HRD calipers and they look almost identical.

I'm just wondering if folks have or can share experiences with doing this on frames that aren't explicitly designed for 650b wheels.

gravelcycling,esiqrl,Hydraulic or mechanical disc brakes,"Hello everyone 
I have recently begun looking for a gravel bike to supplement my road bike, and am wondering how big a difference there is between hydraulic and mechanical brakes. I used to do a fair bit of mountain biking and there the motto seemed to be ‘hydraulic or bust’, yet I’m noticing that quite a few mid-tier and even high end gravel bikes come with mechanical brakes. Is this because mechanical brakes are less of a disadvantage for gravel than MTB’ing or is it perhaps because some of these bikes also are built with other things in mind (ie touring and commuting)?
Will mechanical disc brakes suffice for someone looking for a gravel fix once in a while and a bit of single track on a budget?"

gravelcycling,erl25n,Canyon Grail AL 7.0 vs. Canyon Inflite AL SLX 5.0? Differences and similarities?,"Been off a bike for quite a while, in part because we have been moving around so much, but now that we are settled, I would like to pick it back up.  Like the Canyon Grail AL 7.0 a lot for my use because our home backs up into what was once a golf course, but is now greenspace (think HOA maintained park).  Anyway, it is now open season to bike the miles and miles of golf-cart trails looping through the space.  That is not all I have in mind to do, but it is too convenient to believe I won't be doing that most often.  Those tracks can have heavy foot traffic in summer months, and golf cart paths do things that make no sense outside the game of golf, so I need to be able to zip off the pavement into the turf to, e.g., avoid anutty hairpin that makes no sense or a family on foot, hence my rationale for the gravel bike.

Canyon does not have stock of the [Grail AL 7.0 ($1799)](https://www.canyon.com/en-us/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/grail/grail-al-7.0/2370.html?dwvar_2370_pv_rahmenfarbe=SR%2FBK&amp;dwvar_2370_pv_rahmengroesse=2XS) right now, and from what I have gathered, that will probably remain true for about another month or so.  They do have the [Inflight AL SLX 5.0](https://www.canyon.com/en-us/road-bikes-us/cyclocross-bikes/inflite/inflite-al-slx-5.0-race/2100.html?dwvar_2100_pv_rahmengroesse=3XS&amp;dwvar_2100_pv_rahmenfarbe=BK%2FWH#all-components-section-tab) though, and it is marked down from $1699 to $1499.  However, I would really appreciate insight from someone who can better speak to the differences between these two rigs than I can before progressing further.  The tire size peaks my attention a bit, but if we are pretty close to a wash, saving $300 is a good day."
gravelcycling,erj8yf,Converting to a 1x setup,"Hey folks, looking for a little help. 

I ride a Pinnacle Arkose D3 with a Shimano Sora rear road derailleur and a FSA MegaEXO Adventure chainset (48/32). The BCD of this chainset is 120bcd

I recently bought a Garbaruk 120bcd narrow wide chainring and the manufacturer confirmed with me that this chainring would fit if I fitted shorter bolts. However this size of the threads on the new chainring are larger. This chainring was intended for a Sram XX MTB chainring. 

My current BB size is bb-4000. Could anyone recommend a narrow/wide chainring that would fit my current chainset. Or recommend a set of cranks that will fit my current chain ring.

gravelcycling,er7u1a,How I got big tires to fit my singlespeed,"AKA Don't be dumb like me

So I wanted to set up a Soma Delancey, which is an older steel frame with horizontal dropouts, for gravel. I ran into an issue with 35 and 38 tires rubbing on the rear brake bridge. I don't want to go down to 32s, so I put everything back in the shop and pouted for about a week (after trying to get 35s to fit in a 1984 Peugeot).

Then today, as I was thinking about 650b wheels and other random things, it occured to me that I could probably put a link in the chain, move the wheel back and I'll have vertical clearance. Sure enough, I popped in another link and that allowed me to run a 44x18 with the wheel an inch further back in the dropouts. This is with 38 tires. However, the brake pads are rubbing the tires, but I have some long reach Tektros I can slap on there.

If you are dumb like me, remember that moving the wheel back in the dropouts will give you a lot more clearance, at the expense of adding a chain link and possibly changing brakes."
gravelcycling,er6jqb,Who makes this fork?,"So I have a cyclocross bike with a carbon fork on it. It's a Winwood disc cross fork with a measurement of 400mm axle to crown.

I have my eye on a new Hakka, but my hang-up is whether to go 650b or 700c. Ibis lists 40mm as the widest 700c it can take, but I have seen reports of people using wider, so I would love input from any Hakka owners about max tire width. 

On the 650b side, I would love the extra cushion, and I already have a road bike so I don't really need the Hakka to double as one. On the other hand, the rides I will be doing will have around 10-15 miles of pavement, so I am curious how much of a detriment 650b will be in those situations. 

Any additional inputs appreciated as well!

So I wanted to get a gravel bike for a big guy, and a few people recommended the [Canyon Grail CF SL 7.0] (https://www.canyon.com/en-us/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/grail/grail-cf-sl-7.0/2374.html?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgebwBRDnARIsAE3eZjQBVss48g67TV3lL_UXUGeBWWls3QsQr4hg1fyBsDkjMTi_odoHueMaAvT5EALw_wcB) as a great entry-level gravel bike available in XXL.

The problem is that Canyon says there's a 260lb limit for rider + bike and having never owned/ridden a CF bike, I'm worried this will be a problem since I'm currently 270lbs. I had a similar fear when I bought the Roscoe, which had a 300lb max weight and I was 325 when I got it).

For those of you who have ridden different versions of the same or similar bike, do you feel like the dropped stay frames provide the additional compliance and aero benefits that they claim or is ride feel pretty much similar?"

I'm pondering my mid life crisis dream bike. I got the gravel bug over the past year but live in the Boston area so the majority of my riding is road only. I like to do fast group rides on the road when I'm not crunching gravel. 

Questions:
1. Is there much disadvantage on the road with a gravel bike using road wheels? I'm looking at a Ribble CGR, GT Grade, Cannondale Topstone, and Ocoee Boundary
2. I'm convinced GRX is better for gravel. Is it a disadvantage when you're on the rivet at 28 mph?

gravelcycling,eiwwdi,What are you exited about in the 2020 Gravel-szene,"I would find it interesting to discuss new Trends and upcoming topics to the ever growing Trend of gravelcycling 

 personally I would love to have a potent but affordable E gravel bike for my daily Commute in the morning, 35km on mostly unpaved roads."
gravelcycling,eisr63,Pedal recommendations,"So I’m working on saving up to buy a gravel bike this year. Just curious on everyone’s pedal preferences. I currently ride a road bike with speed play pedals, but I haven’t read great reviews for their off-road pedals. Let me know the pros and cons of your pedal choices.

gravelcycling,eirnaz,2015 OG Specialized Diverge feedback,"I picked up a 2015 diverge and trying to decide if I should keep it.  Tried to put bigger tires on but the 38s I tried didn’t fit because of front derailer. Also concerned about the scs issues if I want to upgrade wheels. If I keep I think I need to do a 1x conversion with wolf tooth chainring, roadlink and 11-36 cassette.  Then I could get at least 35mm tire, maybe 38 slick since it won’t be hitting FD.  I will be mainly riding flat and rolling hills in Indiana with pretty good gravel.  Start changing setup to try make work or get rid of it?  What tires and setup are you liking on your OG diverge?"

gravelcycling,ei5d4g,Gravel bike for older or senior riders,"Hello!

I'm shopping for a gravel bike for my Dad (67 years old) as this genre of bike seems ideal for older riders: increased stability with the larger tire widths and lower pressures, lower gear ratios to make steeper gradiants more attainable and relatively relaxed riding geometries. My dad will be coming from a traditional road bike (a 6-7 year old LOOK) and does most of his riding on-road, though I imagine he may get into some trail riding on his new gravel bike. He enjoys casual rides (usually &lt; 50 miles) and places priority on comfort and stability over speed and efficiency. My budget is around $5,000.

Thus far, I've looked closely at

* Cannondale Topstone: neat suspension system that seems to make it a great all-arounder 
* Lauf True Grit: I like the simple front fork suspension system and I give them bonus points for being a ""small"" independent manufacturer
* Rondo Ruut: the adjustable geometry sounds intruiging for someone looking to keep the riding position more relaxed

Any thoughts/recommendations on the models I've listed or others to consider?

Thanks for your input!"

gravelcycling,ehrvsw,"Which 700c tire for half dirt/gravel, half pavement?","Hello, I have a Salsa La Cruz that fits 700c wheels up to 42mm width. My riding is in rural Vermont which has a mix of dirt roads (hardpack gravel), some pavement (usually in rough condition) as well as some actual single track gravel rides on occasion. I usually ride this bike on actual roads although where I live the ""roads"" are pretty rough; I have a separate bike (Surly Karate Monkey) for real offroad riding.

Therefore, looking for a tire for mixed surfaces that won't slow me down too much on pavement, but will provide some traction on dirt.

Looking for a tire that is between 40mm and 42mm (max size for the frame). Looking in particular at the [Surly Extraterrestrial](https://surlybikes.com/parts/extraterrestrial) (41mm) and [WTB Resolute TCS](https://www.wtb.com/products/resolute) (42mm). It looks as if both of these models are good for mixed surfaces, with the Surly being maybe slightly better on pavement and the WTB being more gravelly. Any other suggestions? My rims are not tubeless, if that matters. I kind of like the WTB tires if nothing else because they are the widest I can take...I know there are many more options at 40mm but all else being equal, I'd like wider for comfort--I'm 50M and riding on these roads can be punishing.

I recognize that a do-it-all tire will require some compromising. Swapping tires or wheels depending on the ride isn't really a good option because just about any ride I do will have at least some dirt and some pavement because of where I live. I'm currently riding Schwable Marathon Supreme (40mm) which isn't too bad on hardpack, but it's more of a pavement tire.

Thank you for any suggestions!"

\- crankset: Ultegra 6800 with custom 48T and 34T

\- cassete: 105 11-30T, it's ok

\- FD: CX70 because bike has top pull

So.. I want to make some changes and have two ideas:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Change 48T to 46T, also change cassete to HG700/HG800 (11-34). No problem with FD, no problem with RD, shoul be ok but.. this cassete has much bigger differences and will be not ""as smooth"" as current. But not sure, is it real problem for ametur? 
2. Change crankset to 46/30 - in that case, I will have 46T and also 30x30 in the lowest gear. Sounds fine, but.. not sure current FD will compatible with RX600 crankset. There is also FSA Omega in better price, but I don't know anything about that crankset. Is it good?"

I'm wondering if anyone has done the durty bikes series in central New York, and if so if they have any advice on tires or gearing.

I've got a cannondale superx with some worn out wtb riddler 37s that need replacing. Looking at the course maps there's a decent amount of road, but most of the major climbs are gravel. I'm not sure if I should replace the riddlers with something more smooth rolling, or with something with more tread.

On the gearing side I've got force 1x11 with 40x11-42 and I'm worried I'll spin out on the road sections. I've got a 44tooth in a box someplace that I could throw on. Not sure how bad I'll be punished by that.

Are any of these road bike-able? I've got a rim brake sl5 tarmac that I've ran 28s, and might be able to squeeze 30s on. I've ridden this on some decent gravel in the past. I'd kinda would like to avoid this as I don't have a great set of rim brake tubeless wheels.

They are tubed, 5 bars pumped. I'm so desperate I'll give a try tubeless. But from now, I have to be very cautious on what I'm riding. My previous tires were Continental Contact Speed, no punctures after one year, including more than 1000km between Poland &amp; Germany. Less than half the price.

I've been thinking about picking up some 650b wheels to run 47/48mm tires.

I spent a lot of time riding this bike with 28mm road tires so I think the 650bx47 should be similar in diameter, right? So maybe the bottom bracket drop won't be too bad. Do you think there's a big enough difference between 700x42 and 650x47 to make the switch worthwhile? I'm a bigger rider at 6'5"" 235lbs so I like the idea of a bit more cushion over bumps and wondered if this would help in mud and looser gravel. Any input is appreciated. Thanks!!"

gravelcycling,ebbdyl,Bombtrack Size Help.,"Hey,
Looking at the Bombtrack Hook EXT but I’m struggling to find information on sizing.
My height is 190cm, inseam is 84cm and a wingspan of 196cm. I assumed XL, as did the guy at my local bike store. They had a L in stock which I test rode and he was surprised and said it looked pretty good. I emailed another store with my measurements and they recommended the XL.
Wanted to ask if anyone had experience with them and how they find the sizing?

I should add that I have been riding hand me down bikes from my dad which are probably slightly too small for me so it’s hard to compare what feels “right”.

Thanks!"
gravelcycling,eazu7t,Diverge comp carbon 2019 vs revolt advanced 2 2020,"Hi everyone, I'm from the UK and want to swap my 2018 allez elite in for something more comfortable on the rubbish rural roads where I live. I would also like to try some bridalways and gravel tracks. I'm not too worried about speed as I am primarily a runner so don't have the quads lol.
 
I have road both of these bikes and really like them, however I'm not sure on the future shock as I wouldn't want it to make the ride boring. 
 
The diverge also comes with ultegra whereas the revolt has 105 but the diverge can be had for the same price as it is over £1000 off. 

Any thoughts would be great, cheers"
gravelcycling,ean9ou,Gravel bike suspension discussion,"Curious about all the different suspension systems being tested out on gravel bikes now. It seems like every bike company has their own take on adding 20-40 mm of travel to gravel bikes.

# Front suspension types:

* [Lauf fork](https://www.laufcycling.com/product/true-grit-frameset) which is a leaf spring fork with 30 mm of travel
* [red shift stem](https://redshiftsports.com/shockstop-suspension-stem) which is an elastomer stem with 20 mm of travel
* [specialized future shock](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/future-shock) which is 20 mm to fork travel with a spring

# Rear suspension Types:

* there are a ton of seat post suspension designs that have been around forever (eg thudbuster)
* [trek isospeed](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/inside_trek/isospeed/) which “decouples"" the seat tube from the top tube
* [moots elastomer softtail](https://moots.com/bike/routt-ybb/) which gives 20 mm of travel to the rear of the bike
* [Cannondale topstone pivot](https://bikerumor.com/2019/06/20/cannondale-topstone-carbon-gravel-bike-rolls-a-new-frame-with-kingpin-rear-suspension/) which adds a pivot for the seat stays so the seat post be more vertically compliant

Then now there are even full suspension gravel bikes like the [niner mcr](https://ninerbikes.com/pages/the-mcr-9-rdo)

And there are probably more than the ones I am showing here. I am looking for a new bike and seeing all these different sorts of options. Some bikes have just front suspension, some just have rear suspension, some are just steel bikes where the frame is compliant. 

* Do you have suspension on your gravel bike? Just front, just rear, both? 
* Do any of these technologies seem to be better or worse than the other ones?
* Do you worry that the suspension tech on these bikes will get outdated quickly and it will be hard to find parts?
* Do you worry about the maintenance upkeep of having shock on your bike? 

I have a full suspension mountain bike and shock maintenance does add a good bit of yearly cost so I am definitely leaning towards something no/low maintenance. Curious about thoughts here"

gravelcycling,e9dxez,Question about gravel riding and manufacturers.,"So I currently have a Fuji carbon road bike, Greg LeMond steel road bike, and a Felt hardtail 29'er.  For my 2020 goals, I've decided that I want to try Dirty Kanza (either the 50 or 100) but  I don't have a gravel bike in my stable.  I live in rural Missouri, so I have tons of gravel that I could ride on.  I also don't think those distances would be much fun on my 29'er.

  
I'm just wanting to dip my toes into it for now and spend around $300-500 then upgrade if it is something that I think I would enjoy and do more often.  My friend suggested converting my Greg LeMond to a gravel bike, but it's in too nice condition and I'd rather leave it stock.  I wouldn't be opposed to buying an older road bike that has been converted or I've looked at the possibility of bikesdirect.com to find an entry-level bike.  If I go the conversion route I'd have to find one already built as I don't have the skills to do it myself and I have no local bike shop.

  
Now my question on manufactures is that I see that Kinesis builds the frames for the [bikesdirect.com](https://bikesdirect.com/) bikes along with other companies such as Kona, Jamis, and several other ""name brand"" bikes.

  
Are any of the Motobecane, Dawes, Gravity, or Windsor frames the same as some of the ""name-brands"" manufactured by Kinesis, and if so, which ones?  I'm assuming that they are and the components are where the big differences will be between the two.

Would you guys be scared of a BD bike on one of the smaller Dirty Kanza routes?  I'm not interested in the racing, just the ride, and the personal challenge."
gravelcycling,e98c5t,Where are you buying your GRX groupsets?,"Per the usual, US-based Shimano retailers are charging double what European Shimano dealers charge. Instead of lowering prices in the US, Shimano just clamped down on European retailers shipping to the US.

gravelcycling,e7hn82,Tyre recommendation,"Hello,

I would like some advice on tyres.

I have been running Schwalbe G-One Allrounds (35mm, tubes) and they have been ok, although in my opinion they wear out quite quickly, and are prone to punctures.

Most of my riding is on loose medium gravel, fine crushed chalk gravel and loamy forest paths with roots.

I mainly ride for fun, but I do compete in at least one local gravel race per year (1st place 2018 and 2nd place 2019) so I ideally want something quite supple.

It’s time to get new tyres and I am thinking of changing to something else. I’m also going to buy new tubeless compatible rims, so that I can run the new tyres tubeless.

Currently I’m trying to decide between:
WTB Riddler/ Nano
Maxxis Rambler
Schwalbe G-One Allround/ Bite
Continental Terra Trail/ Speed

Are there are any real-world experience reports comparing the two derailleurs?

gravelcycling,e5jf0l,Since we are talking about wheelsets (and I don't want to hijack the other thread) and weight...,"I've been doing some serious soul searching over a new bike. One of the bikes I'm seriously considering is steel. It comes with a fancy carbon wheelset. Hubs could be better, but people say they do fine. I currently ride a cyclocross for all my gravel needs. It's fine for the first 50\~60 miles, but after that, I'm feeling cramped (frame is also a size too small, but a stem and fit worked well enough). It's a bit racy, aluminum frame that is basically a caadx of about 2014 vintage (geo wise anyway), Whisky no 9 fork up front, 105 groupset, and Stan's Iron Cross wheelset. This Stan's wheelset leads me to my newest head scratcher. 

The reviews point to them weighing between 1490 and 1510 grams with tape ( [https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/stans-notubes-iron-cross-wheelset-review/](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/stans-notubes-iron-cross-wheelset-review/) and  [https://www.cyclingweekly.com/reviews/wheels/stans-notubes-iron-cross-team-wheelset](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/reviews/wheels/stans-notubes-iron-cross-team-wheelset)), which is much lighter than the carbon wheelset on the bike I'm looking at. In fact, it's lighter than many carbon wheelsets until you spend some BIG bucks (well, tbh, the Hunt 30 doesn't rack up the huge tag some other sets do). 

So... my question. Am I missing something? Have wheels gotten heavier? Is carbon just naturally heavier? I do know I need to get mine trued, and it will be the second time to do so, as they seem to bend somewhat easier than I'd like. With that in mind, maybe they were made too light for the duties at hand?"

The last thing I'm having trouble deciding on is whether I should go with the Sora model or the Apex 1. They're identical aside from the drivetrain. 
I'm a clyde, and I appreciate a bailout gear from time to time. The Sora has a slightly lower bottom gear, but the top gear is probably taller than I would ever really need with the type of riding I will be doing.

Stumbled across the Felt Breed 30, and looking at the specs on the website, it checks a lot of boxes comparable models from other brands don't - threaded BB, carbon steerer, tons of frame mounts for bottles / bento box.

1. Cannondale topstone sora 2020 (price: EUR 1099): It is really difficult to find one available this time of the year but I managed to pre-order one through LBS to be delivered in two weeks time. I like this bike, did test ride on the 105 version and loved it. Size is perfect. Only downside is that the stock wheels are not tubeless ready. It will cost a lot if I want to go for tubeless in the future. One advantage is that I will be buying from an LBS, which is very supportive. 
2. GT Grade Elite 2020 (price: EUR 899): Grade has a good reputation for the previous versions but I could not find any review on this new aluminum version. It comes with claris, which I think ok for me as a beginner. Plus, it has tubeless ready wheels (not the tires though). Other components are similar to the topstone sora except the gear with EUR 200 less and plus I will have the option to switch to tubeless in the future. Downside is that I can only order it online. I did order a bike online before and had to return it due to faulty parts. The process has been terrible and I am still waiting for my refund. I checked the website of GT and they are saying they will not provide warranty for the bikes purchased online, they only provide for the ones purchased from the dealers. I will have only 2 years warranty from a company 1000 km away from me. In this respect topstone sora is a better option. But considering tubeless ready wheels and almost same components except the gear with EUR 200 less money, GT grade elite is very appealing. 

At this point, I would appreciate if you could shed some light on the matter from your experience. 

1. How was your online purchase experience. Is warranty from the GT company really important?
2. If you could pick one right away, which one would you choose?

I have CX bike, which I've used for about three years also as road bike and gravel bike... But it was always a lot of compromises. Year ago I moved and new the new neighborhood has a lot of low quality or damaged roads, road cycling is not great here. 

I'm thinking about replace current bike by custom gravel, but based on MTB. It because lack of comfort - my frame allows me to use max 700x37c tires, but optimal size is 700x35c. Maybe you know Decathlon - I plan to buy Rockrider 900 carbon version and make some changes:

&amp;#x200B;

* it has boosts hubs, so it's ok
* change RS Reba fork to rigid, carbon fork (it's enough for me)
* change tires from MTB-specific to someting like Gravelkings SK but in size 1,5"" - 2,0""
* it has 1x12 drivetrain, (34T - 10-50T) to it should more than enough... probably?
* change Mavic Crossmark wheels to other, lighter custom-build

I modified my chainset and it's now Ultegra 6800 with custom 48T big ring and 34T small ring - perferct for me for roads. I also use 11-30 (11s) cassete... and consider to change this to 11-34T.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't need lower ratio, have enough power, but... this 48T is sometimes problematic on gravel rides - I must use biggest rings on cassete, or move to small ring on front. A lot of changes, not comfortable. This 11-30 has smaller spaces in the  beginning (11-12-13...) than 11-34 (11-13-15...)  so it should be better on gravel rides...but I'm not sure. What about changing comfort on road rides? Do any 11-34 cassettes users can say something about that?"
gravelcycling,dx8l8p,Groupsets,I just purchased a used Salsa Warbird (2017) with the 105 groupset to get into gravel riding. I am wondering if I should change it to a gravel specific groupset (GRX).

Anyone have experience/opinion on the comparison?

I've never had a problem with these wheels before and I've primarily used Gravelking slicks or GP5000s tubeless. Both those sets of tires needed topped off maybe 5 psi overnight using Orangeseal.

How would I know if this is a tire issue, or maybe the weather is just too cold (northeast MA) for the Orangeseal to really seal up the tires? I have the GP5000s tubeless on my road big and they're holding air no problem. 

I got these at REI so if it's a tire issue hopefully there won't be an issue returning them."

I picked up a 2020 Kona Sutra, the non-LTD model, mostly for riding old, un-maintained pavement as a way to remain active through hiking injuries, when I don't have access to mountains, on short bikepacking trips, etc.

I see a lot of conversations about what exactly constitutes a ""gravel"" bike, and am drawing that a lot of bikes can be converted into more gravel capable rides by changing out a few parts here and there. My question is, can I simply take the Kona Sutra on an occasional gravel day without worrying about ruining anything major on the bike? I was thinking I would just remove the fenders and rear rack, and go about it that way. Whatever the case may be, can anyone recommend how I might go about making the bike more versatile instead of buying a separate bike? A second set of wheels, gearing, tires?"

gravelcycling,dtetgz,A Tale of Two Geometries: how different would two bikes feel based on their frame sizes?,"Hey there, I'm looking at the 2020 Bombtrack Hook EXT-C and trying to get a feel for how that might feel compared to my current main bike, a Trek Domane. When I look at the geometry, the differences look really minimal, the biggest simply being a 2CM difference in Stack. Everything else dials in pretty tightly, so I'm trying to imagine what I might expect in handling differences, for example.

Here are the two bikes:

Bike | Bombtrack | Trek
---|---|----
Stack (mm) | 590 | 611
Reach (mm) | 380 | 380
Seat Tube Angle | 73° | 73°
Head Tube Length (mm) | 170 | 195
BB Drop (mm) | 67 | 78

Fork Offset (mm) | 50 | 48

gravelcycling,dpu09c,First &gt;1.000 hm tour since 5 years. I'm dead beat and it feels awesome.,"I used to go MTBing since I was a boisterous teen. Unfortunately I had to ~~quit~~ pause cycling very suddenly in 2014. At first I feared I could never ride a bike in a sporty manner again. But things change so I bought a new gravelbike about half a year ago. 

As the gravel thing was pretty new to me, I had to find my favorite style of riding. Climbing my favourite mountains and descending them, shredding trails and jumping as I used to do...nah, not with a gravel bike. Upgrade my bike with fenders, bags and numerous bottlecages to go bikepacking....nah, not enough time. Doing long runs exploring the nature....sounds great!  


Disenchantment came quick when I realized my stamina and muscle condition was gone after those years of not cycling. So I basically had to start from the bottom again. I'm not really into planned training and stuff, I'm more like ""you grow with your tasks"". So I started to increase the distances and altitudes on my tours.   


Today was the first tour since 5 years I accomplished to cover 75 km and 1.100 hm. Some of you won't propably even consider this a ""long"" tour, but for me it's a milestone! The last kms I fought with sore muscles and cramps, but I did it!  
Now back home everything is aching and I can barely stand up and walk. But it was all worth it.

I'm so proud that I'm back at my old level and just wanted to share with you guys!  


Keep it up and always ride safe!!!"

Trek Checkpoint SL 5

I'll build whit sram force 1x and some deep section carbon wheels (they exist? Or i should mount some road ones and hope for the best?) 

Also the gearing, im new to the world of 1x, on my road bike i use a 54/39 11/30 for everything, what i should use on gravel? I like to push heavy gears on the flat and on steep climb if I don't have a light gear I literally explode"

My thinking is that most of my weight will be over the front wheel with less rolling resistance while the Rutland brings up the rear with lots of traction for climbing. This combo will minimize the weight and both are available in my personal preference tan walls. I realize mtb tire selection favors a tire with larger tread in the front and smaller tread in the rear. What do you guys think? Is my logic flawed?"

To keep up with the other roadies I may be riding with, I’m considering purchasing a second wheel set with skinnier road tires. I know I could simply swap the tires, but I’m a huge fan of tubeless and would like to run tubeless on both sets.

gravelcycling,dmwg4c,How to pick a size when in between,"I currently ride a BMC Time Machine 02 the TT version in Medium Short which I think is a 54.  But after a fit, my LBS cut the seatpost down to get it to the correct height.  After that change I'm happy on my bike til \~4.5 hours...

I've been looking at Trek's Checkpoint to join some friends gravel riding.  I'm 5' 6.5"" with a 30"" inseam and that puts me in between sizes.  I test rode both the 52 and the 54 at a shop.  My first impression was holy crap the hoods are so much thicker than my TT that my hands hurt. (I have little girl sized hands.) Then I noticed that on the 54 I slightly moved down off the hoods and had to keep putting my hands back.  I'm assuming that is because the reach is just a bit too far than I'm comfortable.  The guy said I looked more comfortable on the 52 because I didn't look like I was having to reach as far on the 54.  

Does that mean I should go with the 52?  Is there something I should go back and test first before I choose the size?  My goal for this bike is to ride gravel rides (maybe be talked into a race) for long distances and also purchase road wheels and use it for all the rides with 5K ft elevation gain and more that I've been doing on a tt bike."

He said he'd rather 'upgrade' my mountain bike with new tires (less knobby) and a more upright setup and have me ride more gravel on that until I can ""afford"" a better than entry-level gravel bike.

It's not about affording it to me right now. I spend a ton of time racing my road bike. Any other bike, gravel or mountain, is going to take second place. Am I crazy for wanting an entry-level gravel bike until I decide whether it's really for me?"

gravelcycling,dlw3u8,A few questions before purchasing my first gravel bike,"Hi all,

I have decided that I will purchase a gravel bike today and I am so eager to get started (thanks to all the awesome autumn pictures uploaded recently on this subreddit). :)

I have decided to go with the Ribble CGR 725 Shimano GRX  ([https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/ribble-cgr-725-shimano-grx/build/](https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/ribble-cgr-725-shimano-grx/build/)), as I would really like a steel frame, GRX groupset and hydraulic brakes. Moreover, the bike looks damn cool.

With all that out of the way, I have a few questions to the wheels, tyres and pedals that I hope you can give some guidance on:

**Wheels:**  
The suggested wheels are ""Mavic Aksium Disc"", however, it seems to me that the wheelset is for road use and that it is not ready for gravel tyres. Is that correct?

The other options are 

Mavic Allroad"" (which do not fit disc?) +£50  
Mavic Ksyrium Elite Disc WTS 28mm Wheelset +£450  
Level 40DB Elite Carbon Clincher Wheelset (which do not fit disc?) +£700  
Level 56DB Elite Carbon Clincher Wheelset (which do not fit disc?) +£800

  
**Tyres:**  
The suggested tyres are ""Schwalbe G-One Allround RaceGuard Folding Tyre"". Are these okay for gravel and do they fit the wheels?

**Pedals:**  
I do not have any special preference on pedals, other than they should be appropriate for gravel use. Which of the following would fit the bill?

Shimano PD-R7000 105 Carbon SPD-SL Road Pedals £95  
Look Keo 2 Max Pedals with Keo Grip Cleats - £80  
Shimano PD-EH500 SPD Pedals - £60  
Shimano Clipless SPD M530 Pedals - £35  
Shimano ES600 SPD Pedals - £65  
Shimano PD-M8100 Deore XT XC race SPD pedal - £95  


I apologize for all the beginner questions - I am just trying to make sure that the wheels, tyres and brakes go together. :) I have also reached out to Ribble Customer support, but would like your thoughts as well.

Thanks in advance. Any piece of guidance is highly appreaciated.

I’m going to go tubeless 43/45s either way, so I’m thinking that the Isospeed coupler will be more or less negated by that, and I’m afraid the rear end will feel spongey on long climbs. This is also going to be my race and training bike in everything from good weather to awful mud for a while, and will get flown across the country multiple times, so I’m thinking aluminum may be a better choice in terms on peace of mind with the amount of abuse I’m expecting - I regularly clean and maintain my bikes, but I do treat them like tools to get a job done (also why I’m going 105 over Ultegra). 

I’m essentially looking for a sanity check. Realistically, the ALR is a fantastic bike and I’d be happy with it. But I have a nagging feeling that I’m somehow “missing out” by not going with a carbon frame. Anyone else make a similar choice? Thanks!!"
gravelcycling,dkhqhy,European titanium bike makers?,"I'm looking around buying perhaps a new bike frame and really like getting into a titanium bike, most I've seen come from the US of A, but I'm wondering if there are any good European makers that provide Titanium bikes?     Or at least Titanium bikes located in European stores / shops that ship within Europe, as import taxes from outside the EU is killer.

I've bought my first bike that was set-up and built by my LBS, along the years I've learnt to maintain it and strip it bare to install new components, etc. with the experience and knowledge gathered, I really want to build a bike myself, Titanium seems the preferred choice.

Thanks in advance!  Would be very grateful for feedback."

gravelcycling,dj176h,1st Timer to Clipless!: Crankbrothers Candy 2 vs. Mallet E LS vs. Doubleshot 2 ?!?!?!?!?,"Hey Everyone!  

After some thought, I want to make the switch to clipless pedals.  Doing longer sustained gravel/pavement mixes lately and I feel a clipless pedal could help with some efficiencies.  To be clear, THESE WILL BE MY FIRST CLIPLESS PEDALS.  I am pretty set on going with a Crankbrothers pedal but am battling internally about which one to go with.  Feel free to change my mind.  I want to weigh in a number of factors including these being my first time going clipless, weight, platform, and really any other factors you could think of.  

Here are my choices:

* **Candy #1 (composite and 294g/pair, 52mm Q-Factor) or Candy #2 (aluminum and 355g/pair, 52mm Q-Factor)**
   * The candy series is the has the smallest platform for you feet to sit on, making them a little harder to use in hairier situations but if I am mainly staying on gravel trails and roads this might not be the worst problem.  These are the lightest of the bunch and I could easily change out to my flats if needed for some grocery getting in town or a fun run.  These pedals also have the shortest spindle length (Q-Factor) sitting in at 52mm of the bunch.
* **Mallet E LS (aluminum and 424g/pair, 57mm Q-Factor, 6 adjustable pins)**
   * I am opting for the LS version over the regular Mallet E as the center of my current flat pedals measure to be closer to the 57mm (Q-Factor) spindle mark rather than the shorter 52mm (Q-Factor) spindle mark on the standard Mallet E.  These have a larger platform and some reviews state that you could potentially use these pedals without cycling shoes if you were running quick to the store, short commute, etc.  This version goes up in price and weight.  The thing that appeals most to me about the Mallet E is the larger platform over the candy.
* **Doubleshot 2 (aluminum and 395g/pair, 57mm Q-Factor)...might go for Doubleshot 3 for added adjustable pins.**
   * These are Crankbrothers hybrid version of pedal. One side is Flat, one side is Clipless.  Amazon has some great reviews about this pedal but on other forums and such they don't hit the mark.  I've read a lot of riders choose this pedal as first time clipless but eventually opt to go full on clipless soon after.  I have also read that the flat side can be slightly slippery.  This was originally the option that I was going to go with but I did as I always do and begin to analyze every option out there.

If anybody reading this has any insight into going clipless, the options that I have picked, or even some alternative options, please let me know!  I want to make this decision in the most educated way as to make riding more enjoyable, efficient, and fun!

***P.S. I am also currently looking at cycling shoes and having an equally hard time...there are some Five Ten Kestrels on sale at REI but I have also fell in love with the Northwave Spider 2.  Again, looking mainly for longer gravel grinding with some pavement in between but also don't mind getting off the biking and hiking a bit!***"

gravelcycling,dgkbjl,Second wheelset- another 650b or get a 700c set?,"Thinking about getting a second wheelset to upgrade the stock wheels that came on my bike and have an easy way to switch tires between road rides and gravel. I'm looking at the cheaper Mason x Hunt wheelsets but open to recommendations.

I'm also looking to get some tires with more tread than the Horizons for muddy/slick grass conditions.

Bike: Surly Midnight Special with stock 650b Alex Adventurer wheels, WTB Horizon 47 slicks

Typical use: 1-2 shorter road rides/week, 1 longer gravel ride/week. No need for snow tires where I live.

Pros for getting a 700c wheelset: more flexibility in the future, can use some lighter/skinnier tires for a marginally faster road setup

Cons: If the 700c is the 'road' set, I would have to buy two sets of tires (a 700c road tire and the aforementioned 650b tires with extra tread- thinking WTB Resolutes?). I would also need to switch out spare tubes every time I switched wheels.

Pros for getting a second 650b wheelset: I can switch out tires between wheels as needed, only need to buy one set of tires right now, no need to switch out spare tubes.

Cons: Not all that much out there for 650b road tires, less flexibility overall.

Any thoughts?"
gravelcycling,dgk9u6,Rim Tape for WTB ST i19 TCS rims?,"[Photo from Rollins Pass! Hello from Colorado!](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3cn4xRniV4/)

Howdy! I pulled the plug and bought a Salsa Journeyman Apex 700c bike, and took it on a test ride. The build comes with WTB ST i19 TCS  rims and Teravail Cannonball tires, NOT set up tubeless. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the most part, I'm pretty happy with what it is, given its pricepoint, except for one notable thing: I managed to get four flats in my first 100 mile ride, two being pinch flats (which was an adventure in of itself getting home since I only brought one spare tube). 

Tires were always inflated to spec. The road I was on was pretty rocky - and most likely rockier what this bike was designed to handle (purposely trying to find its limits) ,but the flats always seem to happen not when abusing the bike, but when I happened to  ride over a rock at a casual speed. I never got the sensation of bottoming out to my rim, or anything I'm used to when getting a pinch flat on other bikes. I've also ridden this road with narrower tires, without problems. This makes me wonder what makes these wheels so prone to pinch flats. 

I noticed that these rims don't have traditional rim strips in them, but just a rubberized coating. One theory I'm kicking around is that the build should have an honest rim strip in it, and was not put in for... reasons? I could also just be showing my lack of current knowledge of bike tech. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also guessing that setting up tubeless would help my situation immensely. I do wish complete bikes more often came with setups that were tubeless compatible out of the box. Any luck ghetto-izing this specific pair to work tubeless? I'm willing to experiment."

gravelcycling,dg96pf,Steel gravel bike recommendations,"I'm looking for some recommendations for a higher end steel gravel bike. I have a few frames in mind but won't be able to take a spin on them before dropping the cash.  I'm not sure yet if I want to swap out parts I have to a bare frame or pick up a partial/complete build. I have a nicer 650b wheelset (HED/King) I can swap in but was thinking of running a 700cx45ish wheelset for home riding. I'm located by the coast in NJ, not very hilly and I have to ride a lot of concrete to get to gravel but I do travel around for bikepacking style rides (no racks/panniers). 

Really like my current bike (Kona Rove NRB) but was rear-ended and downtube was dented. Insurance shelled out the full retail replacement value since the mfg doesn't offer a frame set and the frame can't be repaired - though multiple bike shops are convinced the bike, other than being visually blemished, is completely fine.

Looking to stay at $3k-ish or under for frame - under $5k for a complete. I have pretty ordinary proportions - not sure how much is benefit from the extra $$$ needed for ""custom"" frames.  Below are some frames I was interested in - in no particular order

Breadwinner G-Road
Stinner Refugio
Fat Chance Criss Cross
Rove LTD
Rodeo Labs Flanimal
Jamis Renegade Escapade
Fairlight Secan
Norco Search
-Santa Cruz Stigmata (carbon, I know, one I can actually test tho)

The list is longer but these are top contenders for one reason or another. Looking for something quick and snappy in the rear but stabile in the front for bombing down hills and comfortable for all day rides. Again, home riding is a lot of concrete to get to gravel/trails. Will most likely be running a 2x system. 

Any frames I'm overlooking or reasons to exclude some of the above?"

gravelcycling,detv5t,Fork suggestion for a lowrider rack?,"So I have this cobbled together gravel bike that's not really a gravel bike. I think I'll call it 'Mission Creep' as it's a Kona Esatto all-road, which got a Jake fork when I decided I wanted to make it more gravel-y and the stock fork barely cleared ""30mm"" (36mm measured...) CX Jets, and then I decided I wanted to be able to bikepack on it.

After a 3-day trip of the C&amp;O canal this spring, I've decided I'd like to move my panniers to my fork. I like my setup, I just want to get most of the extra weight off the back end (I'm all the weight it needs) and even it out some. I had an Anything Cradle with my tent body &amp; Helinox chair on the bars, and that wasn't close to evening it out.

Looking for suggestions on a 'modern' carbon fork (12 or 15mm TA, post or flat disc, tapered steerer) with lowrider mounts. Or a rack for that matter, though I'm thinking Tubus Tara. I like the looks of the Salsa Down Under, but it apparently requires inner &amp; outer mid-blades, which aside from the Waxwing fork they don't sell separately are found on roughly no forks fitting my needs. I was about ready to buy a Fyxation, but then saw they specifically say that all their mounts aren't for racks, only cages &amp; fenders. I've got my eyes on take-offs from a Checkpoint (seems like it should work) or a last-gen Diverge (which apparently might not fit &gt;35mm tires) but I'd like to make this the last time I swap forks.

I am looking at the following options:

* a camelbak reservoir on my back
* get a saddlebag and store a bottle under the bike by the bottom bracket. Even using the camelbak dirt series bottles, the bottles get pretty gross there and its not quite enough capacity
* get a rear hydration system for two more bottles (like the xlab wing series) but these seem to run the risk of bottle loss

This turned into a whole day full of going to see a doctor and then having to file a report with the local sheriff- ugh. Avoided that area like the plague, and was riding for a while with not too many issues. A few little tiny dogs here and there that were easy to get away from without issue. Then, on a solid 60mi gravel ride I encountered 5 dogs in total. 2 tiny ones, 2 big ones which were old and didn't chase me too far, and then two loose rottweilers that I saw further down the road and dipped the hell back the way I came. The thing that concerns me is, it's actually really hilly out here in parts. NE Kansas is anything but flat, and those two rottweilers were actually towards the base of a pretty steep kicker I was about to go up, and one of my primary concerns, other than a dog getting in front of my front wheel, is getting attacked while going up one of these hills, because there's no way, on some of the chunky loose gravel we have here, that you'd be able to getaway. You'd have to stand your ground, and that's assuming you get off the bike on your terms.

gravelcycling,d9k1ts,Cyclocross vs Gravel Gearing - 1x conversion,"I have a [2017 Giant TCX SLR2](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/tcx-slr-2--2017--2016) that I bought second hand. The guy before me replaced the 105 rear derailleur with an Ultegra 6800. Otherwise it's all stock.

I'm wondering if I should switch the bike over to a 1x system using the new Shimano GRX groupset. It looks like compatibility is good so, I would just need the crankset, derailleur and cassette to make the change. My question is, would a 40T front and a 11-42 gearing make sense for both cyclocross and gravel riding.

The other option I'm playing around with is upgrading the cheap FSA crank to an ultegra 46/36. Would this even make a difference?

I'm not going to be racing at a high level in either discipline, just a handful of Cat 5 cyclocross races and a few long (100+ mi) gravel events. I'm in Wisconsin, so not a lot of long climbs, just short punchy things."
gravelcycling,d9ia67,Let's talk tyres!,"I seem to have killed the Bontrager GR2 tyres I bought last June. I had them set up tubeless but all of a sudden neither tyre would hold air. I tried putting in new fluid but it didn't do the trick so now I have tubes in until I've bought some new ones. I even replaced the rim tape but to no avail. I admit that I've ridden these tyres pretty hard on rough terrain but is it unreasonable to expect a tyre to last more than 3 months (~1500K)? They don't have any visible damage other than slight wear on the tread but they seem to be leaking along the rim. 

What are your favorite tyres?  I'm looking at Maxxis Rambler or WTB Riddler or something similar. Any suggestions? Of course 'tis the season of rain and mud so I should probably take that into consideration."

gravelcycling,d8gw5o,Trouble with Tires,"Purchased a 2019 Raleigh Willard 4 in the spring this year.  I ride in Northern Minnesota, where it is all gravel roads.  Been having tire issues, and out here that is a big issue due to the remote area.

Bike came with HED Tomcat wheels and Clement X’PLOR MSO, 700x40c tires.   I am about 220lbs.

Was getting tube flats so I had the nearest LBS (150 miles away) convert it tubeless.  I was using 40psi for those tires.

That worked for about 1K miles.  I must have nicked a bottle or piece of steel on the road and received my first slashed tire ever. It was a disaster, as I was 30mi from home and the tube didn't like the tire slash.

Ordered some new tires, WTB Nano 700 x 40c TCS. Went back to tubes, as I don't have know how or patience for fitting tubeless yet.  Pumped the WTB tires to 35psi.

The tires feel real squishy, and not fast as before. Are the WTB safe to pump to 40psi?  

Besides the tire issues, the bike is great!"

I was wondering if there there is a place that lists the best current gravel bike deals, as 2019 models are being discounted. For example, our local specialized dealer was offering the Specialized Diverge Comp E5 at $1,500, which is an attractive offer (but I don't love the cream color). 

Quick background: I recently moved to the midwest, and have been using an old MTB to commute into work (6 miles one-way on bike trails) over the last 4 months. I am just getting into cycling, and am interested in picking up a fairly versatile gravel bike I can use as a commuter, be able to take on local gravel trails (and potentially races), and also be able to take on the road (I'm doing a triathlon next summer--I don't need the bike to be competitive, but to not put me at a serious disadvantage). I'd like to spend less than $1,500, but would be willing to go up to $2,000. 

I've currently been looking at the Specialized Diverge and Cannondale Topstone 105, but I would totally be open to additional suggestions!

Currently riding a Trek Multitrack 7000 that has gone through two broken axles, a drop bar w/ bar end shifter modification and am needing something that is a bit more reliable to ride. By that, I mean it's a frankenstein of a bike, rear deraileur from the 90's (struggles to stay in some gears, slips occasionally under high torque), drop bar and shifters from before then, on a hybrid frame.

I don't do a lot of a crazy mountain trails at all, but would like something that can take gravel trails with ease. I've done a lot of reading this last month about what might be best, so I'll try to provide some ""parameters"":

1. Have herniated disc from 15 years ago, it's much better than it was back in the day, but being more upright is certainly preferable. Seems like Jones Bar might be a better option here than drop bars, and they provide versatility over flat?
2. Hydraulic brakes
3. Gravel+ capable, but still plenty road worthy
4. No front suspension seems to be the consensus here?

gravelcycling,d49zu7,Question - looking for suggestions 1x to 2x,"I have trek crockett that fits me super well and is all around a good bike in my opinion.  It came as a 1x for CX racing which I enjoy but find myself doing more gravel type riding on it.  As it turns out, I'm also doing some longer road rides on it and with my 38c tires on there - it's super plush.  

The thing is the 1x gearing leaves a little to be desired for me.  I'm running a 38 up front and a 11x28in back on Rival 1x.  I like the 11x28 steps between gears - but it's not low enough for some of our climbs.  Also - I'm getting smoked on the flats in group rides with a 38x11.

I've got a few options to go 2x but it's going to cost me either way, so i'm looking for advice. 

I like sram - and was thinking about just picking up a left 2x shifter - and then getting a rear derailleurs - I have a front plus the 2x cranks already.  Would be interested in a good gravel suited sram rear derailleur.

The more expensive route would be to buy a new set of shifters and the rear derailleur - which could be something like grx or?  I'm kicking myself a bit b/c I sold a ultegra 11speed group to a close friend - that might have been ideal.  

Does anyone have any suggestions - or has anyone done something similar? I don't want to bodge it - but I also don't want to buy an entire groupset. Thanks for your thoughts."

Sram Force 1

Wheels - HED Ardennes Plus

Tires - Kenda Alluvium Pro 700x40 tubeless

Purchased at Western Bikeworks - Portland, OR

&amp;#x200B;

My main bike has been a 2018 Cannondale Synapse Carbon Ultegra SE.  I've ridden this bike about 7000 miles in the last year. I commute on it about 40 miles a day and do club rides on the weekends. This year I got interested in riding gravel  so I got a 2nd set of wheels and used my original wheels for gravel tires. The Synapse has room for a 700x32 tire so I put some Panaracer Gravel Kings on , set up tubeless. I also tried some 700x35 tires but they was just not enough clearance to keep from rubbing on the frame. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did several gravel events and two races on this setup but came to realize I really wanted more rubber and a bike better suited to gravel. In the second race I competed in I was in the lead group until we reached a long decent that was heavily washboarded. That's when I saw all the guys with big tires bombing past me as I white knuckled it down. Also, my bike was in the shop quite a bit because I was beating the crap out of it asking it to do everything. I've only had the bike for a year and already had to replace the shifter cables twice as well as replace the left shifter under warranty. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did quite a bit of research on gravel bikes; I really wanted to stick to a 1x drivetrain so that narrowed things down a lot. I was trying to stay around $3K so most of what I saw was  Apex and was hoping for at least Rival. I also wanted as much tire clearance as possible and quite a few of the bikes I looked at were limited to 40mm. 

Some of the bikes I considered-

Canyon Grail - Seems like a good value but when I don't like the bars and none are in stock in my size right now.

Cannondale Topstone Carbon - Heavy, no 1x groupset

3T Exploro - Lacks versatility, great price on sale but not in my size

Norco Search XR - Only Apex available in my price range

Salsa Warbird - Awesome, but out of my price range.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately my search led me to this bike which was priced at about $1K off list. Unless you really want to wait and see what develops next year I think this is the best time of year to buy a bike as far as prices go. One of the main things I think will change will be a lot of bikes with the new Shimano GRX groupset, but for me the Sram Force 1 components are fine.  

I live in Hillsboro, Oregon which is a suburb of Portland and riding from my house I can reach great gravel roads within 10 miles. I took the bike out last night on one of my favorite gravel loops and noticed a few things right away. I've got a lot more grip climbing in loose gravel. Before I would have to pick my line very carefully and always stay in the saddle, now I don't have to worry about the road surface much and have good traction even when standing. Descending was amazing; 35mph on hard packed gravel feels pretty much like riding on the road and the rough sections were much faster.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking forward to many more gravel adventures and I'm about to try cyclocross for  the first time ever.

&amp;#x200B;

See ya out there!

I thoroughly enjoy the gravel but good lord the climbs hurt. I have a compact 46/36 ultegra crank with 11/32 in the back and feel like I'm hitting 55-60rpms on the steep stuff which kill the legs. Riding a diverge w 32mm gravel kings (sk) and I feel like I'm earning every inch of those climbs w seated efforts. Am I undergeared or do I just need to hdtfu? FWIW on the road I routinely ride 50mi w 2500ft climb @19 mph average.

gravelcycling,czkt1e,Help decide - keep Wilier Cross or get Jari 2.5 2019.,"There are still a few Jari 2.5 left.  I have one reserved for the day.  With the future of Fuji uncertain, I was considering getting this.  I would get rid of my Wilier Cross bike.

The Wilier is stiff as anything, clearly wants to run fast.  High bottom bracket.  Carbon without lots of attach points.  I can fit a rack in back, and lash on gobs of stuff.  It's 2013 with cantilever brakes.  Has served its purpose of determining that I like bad surfaces and will horribly misbehave when I have a go-anywhere bike (the worst so far was over land, grass, mud, and concrete, then through National Airport - I walked - to get to historic Terminal A).  It's got an odd mix of parts.  Currently a 22-44 triple with 11-27 10 speed, Ultegra bar ends, Ultegra-Open Pro wheels, bars I like.  Suspect I could sell as is, or do a mix and match with my spares to make it more at-home to most.  

The Jari is 520 = 531 steel, which is OK.  I'd rather have 853, but $$$$.  What attracts me are the geometry (has to be more comfy with the steel plus lower bottom bracket, and mellow geometry), lots of attach points for crap, and disk brakes.  The fork attach points are especially appealing.  Claris/Altus 2x8 is a bit of a concern.  I could learn to love that, or go to a 1 x something system.  I don't know how good the Tektro Miro disks are with 160 mm disks.  The wheels are a mystery: Vera Terra DPD18, 32/32h, quick release sealed hubs.   I could replace those, I suppose.  In the old days, I'd be running 4 x 36 hole rims for such use!  

The Jari is 28 lbs.  I imagine the Cross as I have it set is just under 20.  That's got me hesitating.  It beats me up a bit.  I really found the Jamis Renegade Expat in 520 more comfortable.  But I didn't try carrying it.  My Cross ends up carried on most rides, at least up rocks or stairs.  

Any thoughts?  The Jari is $720 including tax, shipped to me here.

Thanks much."

gravelcycling,cyzgfr,Help with purchasing plan,"I’m new to this level of the cycling world so my general knowledge is very low. I’m currently saving up bit by bit for a Trek Crosspoint ALR 5.

Isn’t it potentially cheaper to get one of the lower model numbers and upgrade on my own? I don’t know much in the way of quality gear but I trust my LBS and a friend for their suggestions. I’m not sure which will be better for me in the long run. Wait longer to save up more for the ALR 5 or get the ALR 4 sooner and upgrade parts as I see a need. Which is going to be the better bang for my buck? TIA"
gravelcycling,cyzdxq,"Giving up on Rene Herse tires for off-road rides. What else is fast, supple, and DURABLE?","I’ve been an evangelist for Compass/Rene Herse for a few years now. I absolutely love them on pavement; fast, supple, comfortable, etc. I recently tried to rock the Juniper Ridge (650b x 48mm knobbies) tubeless on my gravel bike and I guess I’m just too aggressive for them.

The problem is that when, (not “if”), you get a puncture and quickly lose air, you will inevitably ride on the flat tire until you can safely come to a stop, and as you do, you will cut many significant holes in the sidewall, rendering the tire useless. The old adage about tubeless preventing pinch flats doesn’t do much good on these super thin sidewalls.

This has happened to me on two consecutive rides on pretty tame gravel logging roads at 25-30psi, essentially costing me $200 and significant delays to my riding group.

It’s frustrating because the ride quality is so nice, but I’m ready to cut my losses. So what would this community recommend for a good replacement in a similar size that won’t leave me hanging so often without being a buzzkill in the ride quality dept? Thanks for your feedback!"

gravelcycling,cylupj,Midback pain on new gravel bike,"I purchased a new Cannondale Topstone and after more than a decade of strictly road cycling am thrilled at the prospect of going on to gravel roads and off the tarmac. For the most part I love the new ride…except that I get persistent mid-back pains, even after just a few kilometers. Even though my body is used to a more aggressive road biking position, something about the more laidback geometry doesn’t quite agree with my back

After the first few rides I measured seat-to-stem and learned that the medium Topstone was 3cm longer than what I have set up on my 54 cm CAAD road bike. I switched out the default 100mm stem for a 80mm. This helped somewhat, but the back pain persists.

I have a few theories, but wanted to get some more opinions from people on here:

1) Go down to a 70 mm stem, bringing the seat-to-stem to exactly the same as on the road bike. The bike shop warned against going for a stem shorter than 80mm, saying that it’d make the bike too twitchy…?

2) Focus on switching / improving climbing technique. The biggest difference I notice between road and gravel is trying to climb on loose ground, and having to really focus on lowering my chin / front and keeping my weight on my back wheel. As a result, I find myself yanking on the hoods to compensate for the pedaling motion. I think this may be a contributing factor. 

Any insight is appreciated."

gravelcycling,cx8s9l,First Glimpse at 2020 updates to Jamis Renegade Line,"I've been eagerly awaiting news about the 2020 Renegade line as I think that will be my next bike.

If anyone else is curious, the first details are trickling out. First, they're ditching the exploit/expat/expert/etc. naming scheme. Looks like everything will just be Renegade S3, S2, C2, etc. for steel and carbon.

S2 photos:[http://1stbike.net/products/detail.php?product\_id=2911](http://1stbike.net/products/detail.php?product_id=2911)

C2 photos: [https://1stbike.net/products/detail.php?product\_id=2908](https://1stbike.net/products/detail.php?product_id=2908)

Scroll halfway down for some gorgeous photos and the spec sheets are on those pages, too.

[According to this site](https://biketek.com/collections/adventure-bikes), the C2 appears to be priced at $2,599. The S2 at $1,999. And the S3 at $1,499. There aren't photos but the full specs are listed in English on those product pages.

As many assumed, they're adopting the Shimano GRX groupsets. The S3 (a slight bump up from the very popular Expat) will feature hydro brakes. The S2 and S3 also have a Shimano GRX threaded BB which is pretty cool.

The Biketek site says they'll be available in October (no idea if that's overly optimistic or not).

They all look amazing the but the S3 looks like it will be a hell of a lot of bike for $1.5K."

gravelcycling,cw9el2,Thinking about a build — talk me out of it,"Hello friendly gravelers,

About a year ago I set out to Frankenstein (read: cheaply) build a gravel bike. I’m now riding a 61cm steel Jamis Aurura touring bike, with 1x10 on a campy crankset and Deore RD (I know!!!). I added a carbon Nashbar CX fork, salsa woodchippers, 35mm Clement nontubeless tires, an 11-42 XT cassette, and a fizik Antares saddle. As far as I can tell, it’s about as smooth, upgraded, and fast as it could be. All in for less than $400. (In an earlier post, ya’ll set me straight and out some limits on how far I could rake the upgrade .. basically: “please don’t buy Hunt wheels for this bike.”)

https://imgur.com/a/ZxreUYN

*im obviously struggling with some fit issues (see seat slammed forward) ... long legs and short torso at 6ft3. 

I’ve read here and elsewhere that you can do things right, cheap, and fast. But pick two.  I got a first kid coming soon and I love wrenching on the bike in the basement ... so let’s drop the “fast.”

Is it totally stupid to build a new bike from the frame up? My ideal new bike would be a Giant Revolt Advanced 2 ($2,100). Goals are 105 level components, carbon frame, and decent wheels. 70% road / 30% gravel. And N=1 because S-1=1. 

Money isn’t the primary factor. In other words, I’m not trying to build because it’s cheaper (or the same dollars but with higher quality).

My thinking is to slowly acquire a new-ish but used frame (likely carbon, but a steel frame like the Niner would be nice too), 105 (or SRAM) or better comps, and buy a new set of Hunts and tubeless. For $2k and elbow grease, scouring craigslist and eBay, is this possible/fun? What could I expect to end up with?

Thanks!!!"

gravelcycling,cvbtl6,Flats and burst tires - need help!,"So I got a gravel bike early this year and it's been fun until July. Almost every second time I go riding I catch a flat tire. Today was the final straw - I came back from a ride put the bike in the corner of my place, 2 hours past and a loud noise woke me up - the tire just exploded, whole sidewall was ripped.

I need a new tire or a set. The current ones are, or rather were WTB Resolutes, which I find great for riding and terrible for changing (putting these on a rim is an exercise in patience and finger pain).

Here is a bunch of questions I have:

1. Which tires are easy to take off and put back on with little issues? Also which would you recommend for puncture resistance? Glass shards are my main enemy.
2. What tubes would you guys recommend for durability, so far I used Schwalbe and Continentals, but they are thin and when you inflate them they get even thinner, no wonder they puncture easily. Maybe putting 29'' tubes from a mountain bike would work?
3. Should I go tubeless? I'd have to change the rim tape or what's it's called. Is it even worth it, considering the price and cost later on?

This is my first gravel bike, I have been ridding a mountain bike most my life and I caught a flat maybe like 3 time in 2 decades, which is less than during the last month. It's frustrating, I just want to ride and not worry about hitting something that deflates my wheel 30 miles from home. The cost of spare tubes begins to add up, and it's especially infuriating when I commute to work. Imagine getting to work, parking the bike only to find it 8 hours later with a flat. I'm also walking to work tomorrow, just great.

PS The bike is a Marin Four Corners 2019."

I live in the gravel city itself and have been riding gravel for almost two years. The entire time I’ve been riding my 2014 Jamis Dakar XC 26”x2.4” Fs mountain bike. She’s 33lbs, but gets me where I’m going. It still has a triple, but I don’t use the smallest chainring in the front so the easiest gear I use is 32-32.

gravelcycling,ctls57,New bike or upgrade groupset,"I keep going back and forth on some options.

It's probably another relatively easy fix if I bring it in but this is getting old. Secondly, the 34 up front and 32 in the back is too high of a gear for me when trying to ride some of the crazier gravel around me (I know fitness is a part of this bit what I wouldn't give for a few extra low gears!!!).

I've though about buying a Topstone 105 for the better 105 groupset and lower gearing with the 46/30 up front, but I'd probably lose a bunch of money trying to sell the Checkpoint. Plus side is a NBD and some lower gears. I could run slightly bigger tires too.
 
On the other hand, I could slap a new 11 speed  GRX groupset with 46/30 chain ring and 11-42 cassette on there and basically gain 3 low gears while only losing 1 on the top end (not worried about that). Competitve Cyclist has the parts and said this should work.

gravelcycling,csr3hf,Least bad option for gravel race set up.......,"So, I've got two bike options for an upcoming gravel race/ride (El Bandito 70km) in Ontario. It's a mix of ATV trails, dirt roads, some paved and a bunch of sand double track. 2,154m of climbing.

Solid XC skills and mid-pack fitness on the road. 215lbs currently.

The prevailing wisdom says a gravel bike sporting 40c tires is the weapon of choice. I do not have one of these. 

So, would you rather run with:

\- A steel cross bike sporting 35c Gravel Kings on Open Pros (w/ tubes)

\- A steel drop bar 29er sporting fast 2"" tires (tubeless Nanos)

\- A ti hardtail sporting fast 2"" tires (tubeless Nanos)"

I’m looking for some new headphones/earbuds for riding. Wondering if anyone can make some recommendations. I’m looking for something that still allows some ambient noise in for safety and preferably something with a cable connecting the two earbuds. I’m paranoid of losing the individual wireless “pod” style buds. Bluetooth is a must.

Budget is $150 or less. What do you recommend?"
gravelcycling,cs1elf,Canyon Grail Discussion,"I have searched the web and have not been able to find a forum thread dedicated for Grail owners to swap tips, experiences and ask each other questions. I feel that the proprietary setup of (at least the CF version) the bike warrants its own topic. 

I got my 2018 Canyon Grail SL 7.0 just about a year ago on sale for just shy of $2K, and received it within 2 weeks.  I can't recall exactly, but shipping for me was fast. 

I personally live in Southern Maine (USA) and work up towards Boston. My favorite area for riding that I can get to easy enough, is the Ipswich area of MA. An awesome mix of trails, roads, and scenery. 

So far I have upgraded the following: 
Selle Italia Novus Gravel Saddle
Maxxis Rambler Tires with EXO protection (awesome)
Tubeless

I like riding on road, gravel, and flowy singletrack. Coming from a MTB background I am interested in making the bike more capable of taking on roots and rocks. I don't have any desire for hitting trails better suited for a mountain bike exclusively, but I find what I really love about gravel riding around me is the variety of terrain I hit on a ride. The road, gravel, and singletrack all feel exciting as one breaks up the potential monotony of the other. 

In my quest to better handle bumps, I bought a pair of Crushcore tire inserts that I've yet to install (they are a real pain to install). I recently bought this for my Trail MTB after cracking a carbon rim and they work like a charm. I feel very confident that the Crushcore is going to be ideal for the gravel bike. In fact I'm certain the Crushcore on a gravel bike is going to keep me from ever considering suspension. I'll report back with my findings in another thread as there is zero discussion about Crushcore on here. 

I have heard of people coming up with interesting lighting setups with the floater bar. I'm really curious about those. I have a good rear visable light, but I am interested in a better front night riding set up. I am interested more about seeing than being seen. If people have come up with nifty night let setups, please share. 

I am also very interested in any clever phone mounts. I'd really like to be able to see my Ridewithgps directions."

gravelcycling,crvyzf,"Vintage bike destroyed in car crash, looking for perspectives on insurance replacement value","Hey folks, 

My beloved 1989 Trek 950 was destroyed last week in a car crash.  I'm not particularly worried about the components, as honestly it's an unexpected opportunity to replace the front wheel with a dynamo one, but the frame...that's another story.

The bike shop I visited for my insurance estimate came up with a value of $600 for the frame and fork both.

Now, i can see their logic on this, that it's an old steel frame that could be replaced by something like a Surly or a Soma, which would come to \~$600.  However, I don't see those options as equivalent.  This frame has high-end investment cast lugs, was silver brazed rather than brass-brazed, and features thin-gauge Double-Butted True Temper tubing.  The construction type, not to mention ride quality, is in my opinion incomparable..

So my question -- is it reasonable to request that a new frame with those same attributes be included in the replacement estimate, or is the shop right in suggesting the frame and value?

gravelcycling,cr976m,Need some advice on a new wheelset,"Hey there, 

Just bought a Fairlight Secan that I'll be building up slowly over the coming winter (frame won't ship 'til November) and I'm already puzzling over what to buy. It seems there are three pretty obvious contenders: 

*Hunt 4 Season for $349, 1629 grams
*Pacenti Forza wheelset, $429, 1710 grams
*HED Ardennes wheelset, $600, 1550 grams (price is much lower than usual price)

Basically I'm pretty stuck and it sorta comes down, are the HEDs 2x better than the Hunts? 

They all seem reasonably comparable, the weight doesn't bother me that much. The internal width is pretty comparable. I have another set of bombproof DT Swiss 500s laced to DT 350s for touring/heavy load work so that's not a huge concern. 

I'm a little curious about the X-Wide 4 Seasons, that 25mm internal diameter looks pretty tasty. But then, it's getting pretty heavy and maybe I should look into some of those super-wide Light Bicycle rims?"

gravelcycling,cqv2qj,How far do you live from gravel?,"Roadie here looking to get into gravel. I think it's something I'd enjoy. One of my favorite rides last year was a gravel ride that I did on a hardtail MTB. And I'll admit that the media, whether it's bike companies or even the posts here on gravelcycling, tends to romanticize riding gravel.

But then I look at the reality of it. I like to get up early in the morning, hit the road at 5:45am and crank out a 40-50 miler and be done so that I can spend the rest of the day doing other life stuff. The nearest gravel to me is about 30 miles away which I'm not going to ride and that means I have to drive. So it's a lot of time to get to gravel before actually riding it.

I commute to work sometimes but mostly ride for fun and fitness.

The Salsa Warbird, Trek Checkpoint, and Specialized Diverge are all on my radar, but I found the Specialized Sirrus Comp X yesterday and it seems like a really good value. 

Carbon frame, 1x11, 700x38 tubeless ready, hydro brakes all for $1659 MSRP. The next closest ""gravel"" bike is around $2500 for a similar arrangement. 

I don't ride in the drops much so I think a flat bar would be fine. I know it won't be quite as fast or as cool looking, but is this bike as good of a value as it seems or am I just being cheap trying to make an old man bike work for me?"

California and San Francisco gravel riders, I need some help with two things:

1. The easy part is that I'm looking for a good route to do in about 4-6 hours, over about 75 miles or so hopefully including some nice gravel and lovely views, starting and ending in the Northeast part of San Francisco where I'm staying. I'm flexible about most of this, I could stand doing a longer or shorter route, time or distance. I just want to get out on some gravel.
2. The thing I'm guessing will be more challenging is finding a gravel bike rental. A brief Google search yielded almost entirely road bikes, the spiciest thing I could find was a Roubaix Expert.   


I'd happily rent the Roubaix if it's the closest to thing to a gravel bike that I can rent, I just wanted to reach out and see if there's anyone out there who knows about a place I can rent something more gravelly, with 40c tires, discs, and a one-by drivetrain or cyclocross chainset, like a 46-36 or something.  


If a gravel bike rental just doesn't exist, I have a backup road route planned that should be plenty enjoyable, but I do road rides in my hometown all the time so I'd rather experience some trails in the surrounding area of San Francisco.

Gear:

[Lauf True Grit, Weekend Warrior edition](https://www.laufcycling.com/product/lauf-true-grit), running 45mm WTB Riddlers set up tubeless. This bike is something else, I can´t recommend it highly enough.

My goal was finishing, second goal was finish under 10 hours. Got both! First 5:30hrs / 80km was all cramping, climbing, headwind and rain. Next 80 went by like a breeze and the last 40 were terrible as the wind had picked up and I was running on empty for the last two hours due to botching the nutrition. Gels are a big nono for me as they messed up my stomach so I couldn´t eat anything. Started cramping badly at around 170kms but crawled over the finish line with a small group that had calories, salts and nutrients in liquid form.

The course was rough. Wet sand, washboard roads, barely roads, and a few hills everyone had to walk. Extremely rough sections in between. Feelings ranged from extreme elation due to the extreme beauty of the surroundings and getting to ride my bike for 10 hours straight, and wanting to break my own legs and throwing my bike into the volcano so I wouldn´t have to go on. I could have been at home ironing my shirts.

gravelcycling,ck91to,New Bike Day! Salsa Journeyman Sora 700c,"This is my first ""real"" bike and I wanted to get something with drop bars that could go both on and off road. After a lot of research and visiting bike shops all over my state, the moment a staff at one of the bike shops showed me the journeyman I knew it was the one. It checked all the boxes I wanted in a bike at a price I could afford. I kept my eyes peeled for a used one, but after a couple of deals fell through I just ended up buying new.

I originally rode the 650 model but wanted something with a little less chunk to the tires. The bike shop had another location with the 700 model which I went to check out and after finally deciding between 55.5cm and 57cm frame, I put my order in. I went with the 55.5cm frame, but could have gotten away with the 57. I'm 5'11"" but apparently I'm mostly torso and my legs are a little shorter than average. I actually found a 57cm model for 10% off MSRP at another (farther away shop) but decided to go with the better fit of the 55.5cm even though I had to pay full MSRP. I felt confident in the price difference because

1) It's the slightly better fit
2) It's from the bike shop that helped me the most and I built a little rapport with them
3) The shop offers 1 year of 10% discounts on gear after spending $1k (which was more than fulfilled by buying the bike)
4) This one is probably the best perk - one year of their full service/tuneups which they valued at $80 each visit. The shop is really close to me so it won't be hard to get to, and being new with bikes I still have a lot to learn regarding maintenance.

They had the white sora model but I preferred the cream color, so I patiently waited for a week until the bike arrived and got assembled. I took it for my first ride yesterday (in the nearly 100°F heat) and that combined with me being totally out of shape, I got in about 5 miles before I had to call it a day.

I joined a local Meetup group that offers rides for beginners to advanced riders and am going to a 10 mile ride this Saturday. I'm extremely excited to get into this hobby and hopefully the bike will serve me well."
gravelcycling,ck73qe,Does anyone here have experience with Soma frames?,"I am currently narrowing down frames for a build that I want put together. I need a new commuter/gravel/light touring setup, and I am finding a couple Soma frames at the top of my list. I really like both the Double Cross Disc and the Fog Cutter, and potentially even the Wolverine. I think any of these would suit my needs just fine. Im slightly worried about quality though. I come from a mostly mountain biking background and have heard a lot of stories of their mtb frames breaking. I am reluctant to let it sway me too much, because our terrain where I live is extremely rocky and steel hardtails usually dont last long (I've even broken a few from other companies over the years). 


Has anyone put a bunch of miles on one of their road or cross frames? Thoughts? I'm half inclined to just pick up a Kona Sutra frameset since I know Kona is really good about warranty issues and their standards are a bit more updated, but I really dig these Soma frames."

gravelcycling,cjushd,Picking the right Gravel bike for commuting and road as well,"Hi there,

new to the Gravel scenes. Recently I've looked into purchasing a gravel bike for next season. This would be mostly for commuting but also long gravel rides and road rides. Would like spend a lot of time on the road so would prefer something that can keep up with roadies as well.

One thing I'm also struggling with is if I should go with 1x or 2x drivetrain. I'm also wondering if its worth going Carbin. Hoping you guys can help me make a smart decision.

Price range is $2000-$3000 Canadian

Here are my top picks so far:

**Price:** $3199 (dealer said they would give it to me for $3000 no tax)

**Drivetrain:** SRAM Apex 1x

**Pros:** Good price, carbon with hydrophilic brakes

**Cons:** Not a fan of the color, less gear range? Lower end 1x setup

# 2020 Giant Revolt Advanced 2 (not available yet)

**Price:** $2799 (dealer said no tax with downpayment)

**Drivetrain:** Shimano 105

**Pros:** Carbon with hydrolic brakes (also 105 not giant for 2020)

**Cons:** Not the best color options for Canada

# 2020 Giant Revolt 0 (not available yet)

**Price:** $2199 (dealer said no tax with downpayment)

**Drivetrain:** Shimano 105

**Pros:** hydrolic brakes, GREAT price

**Cons:** Not the best color options for Canada, aluminum

&amp;#x200B;

# 2019 Devinci Hatchet Carbon Rival

**Price:** $1899

**Drivetrain:** Shimano Tiagra 2x10

**Pros:** sleek design, nice color, GREAT price

**Cons:** Mechanical brakes, Tiagra drivetrain

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any suggestions please let me know. I tend to buy Giant as they usually have the best coponents for the money, so I'm wondering how much the Devinci stacks up with the Giant. The aluminum frames are also much more affordable so wondering if its worth it to go Carbon or not.

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!"

gravelcycling,cjr33k,Felt Breed 30 Vs Salsa Journeyman 650b?,"Hi all,
I am thinking about getting my first gravel bike and was looking for opinions between these bikes.  I currently have a [2017 Specialized Roll Elite](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/roll-elite/p/129284?color=239674-129284) that has been a blast to ride but I looking for something new and more comfortable for longer rides. I am about 6'3"" 200lbs and my shoulder and back already have some issues so I do have some concerns about moving to a drop bar bike.  

I will mostly be riding a 10-18 mile loop to the beach and back (I ride this 2-4 times a week).  It is a combo of street and uneven sidewalks that beat me shoulders up pretty bad when I was riding an older Specialized Sirrus. I would like to start doing some longer rides and hopefully work up the the gravel levy's (20-40+ mile  loops) near the Everglades. 

I love the 650b wheel size so I want to stay with that but I do like that both easily allow for skinnier 700c wheels.

The [Felt Breed 30](https://feltbicycles.com/products/breed-30-gravel-road-bike?variant=18311193788534) looks gorgeous to me and I think the higher gearing is probably better for my use but overall the bike is way overkill for my needs. The price is also quite a bit higher then I was thinking about spending.  

The [Salsa Journeyman Apex 1](https://salsacycles.com/bikes/journeyman_650b/2019_journeyman_apex_1_650) is appealing because of the 1x11 setup but I think I would probably need a larger chain ring. I am not a huge fan of the hot pink color but it seems like the yellow version would be really hard to find.

The [Salsa Journeyman Sora](https://salsacycles.com/bikes/journeyman_650b/journeyman_sora_650) is probably more then enough bike for my needs but you know how it goes, if I spend just a bit more I can have  better! I am also not thrilled with either color these come in but either would be ok.  

Anyway this is WAY longer then I intended but I would love to hear any thoughts."

gravelcycling,cj3lzq,Budget Tubeless Wheel Suggestions,"I recently bought a used Fuji Roubaix to use as a work commuter/weekend road rider, It is a traditional road bike with 23mm tiresqu It was very fast, but I quickly realized that I can stand the feel of high pressure skinny tires. Hitting bumps is kind of bone jarring. However, I did recognize significant efficiency and speed gains over my full suspension mountain bike. The idea of a gravel bike seemed like the perfect middle ground: rigid frame/fork, drop bars, fatter tires. I sold the Fuji and bought a Cannondale Topstone Sora. 

I bought it used, and it came with a set of 40mm Maxxis Velocita AR tires with tubes which I love so far. Because it is a gravel bike, I take the shorter route to work which has a section of hard packed dirt. The bike handles it fine, but I've already went through 3 tubes due to thorns. So now I am looking at getting a tubeless wheel setup, but I dont want to spend more than about $400. I'd also like to be able to run my 40mm tires at 50-60 PSI on the road tubeless.

Can anyone recommend a tubeless wheel set under $400 that can do 50-60 PSI with 40mm tires?"

I've been looking at several bikes and would appreciate any help in making my final decision. Thank you in advance! 

I'm planning on hitting some fire roads, exploring cool trails I come across, and riding pavement to get to gravel. If I get ambitious (and confident) enough I would definitely be interested in doing a gravel event. 

&amp;#x200B;

The options I'm considering are: 

1/ [Jamis Renegade Expert](https://www.jamisbikes.com/new_pdf/19_renegadeexpert.pdf)

2/ [Lauf Anywhere](https://www.laufcycling.com/product/lauf-anywhere) or [Lauf True Grit](https://www.summitbicycles.com/product/lauf-true-grit-21103.htm?variations=223991,223993,223988)

3/ [Argon 18 Dark Matter](https://www.jensonusa.com/Argon-18-Dark-Matter-Ultegra-Jenson-USA-Exclusive-Build)

&amp;#x200B;

**Jamis Renegade Expert**

* Cheapest of the options at $2599
* 50/34T crank and 11/34T cassette doesn't seem like ideal gravel gearing (but I'm not experienced enough to know)
* 40mm tire clearance no 650b option (not sure if I event want to do it, but just a thought) 
* Tubeless ready and comes with tubeless tires

&amp;#x200B;

**Lauf Anywhere**

* Core starts at $2890 with SRAM APEX 1 
* Weekend Warrior starts at $3340 with SRAM RIVAL 1 
* 1x 42T crank and 11/42T cassette seems more sensible gearing for gravel 
* 45mm tire clearance, 650b option
* Tubeless ready wheels and tubeless ready tires (but doesn't come with tubeless tires)
* Threaded bottom bracket so no creaks?!

&amp;#x200B;

**Lauf True Grit** (technically not on the list)

* At $3765 this is the most expensive (and best looking) option and I'm hesitant to get this as my first gravel bike because of that
* The same frame as the Lauf Anywhere but has the Lauf fork and SRAM FORCE 1 ([link](https://www.summitbicycles.com/product/lauf-true-grit-21103.htm?variations=223991,223993,223988))
* Also a 1x42T cank and 11/42T cassette which seems more sensible gearing for gravel 
* Threaded bottom bracket so no creaks!? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Argon 18 Dark Matter**

* Ultegra R8000 2x drivetrain! Great gearing, but maybe not great for gravel riding
* 45mm tire clearance, 650b option
* Tubeless ready wheels and comes with tubeless tires

gravelcycling,ch9zn2,Nothing is easy (Even a free bike),"Good morning All,
This is my first post in gravelcycling, so first off, thanks in advance for any and all constructive feedback. So here's my story.

About 4 months ago I bought a couple of raffle tickets to support our communities budding rail to trails orginization. The drawing was over the 4th of July weekend, with the 1st place prize being an Emonda ALR 4, 2nd being a Trek mountain bike, and 3rd being $500.  I happily won the third place prize of $500. While communicating with a friend of mine in the group about receiving my prize, I mentioned that I had sold my 2005 Trek 1000 roadie last year and regretted it almost immediately, and when I got word that I won the raffle I was thrilled that I had won, one of the new bikes. Long story a little shorter, I was able to trade up my $500 for the Emonda! Now it gets a little convoluted. Talking to the dealer, I found out I was able to trade the Emonda for two other bikes since my wife has been wanting bikes for her and I while on vacation and such. She's not a big rider, but wanted something to tool around on. Now, to the end.....
After too much back and forth with the dealer due to price/available bikes, I have opted for a basic Electra Beach Cruiser and the Trek Checkpoint AL3 for myself. I'm looking for any advice or info from those of you who have owned or have had experience with the Checkpoint.

Needed upgrades?
Recommended accessories?
Concerns?

I plan on using the bike 80/20 pavement to gravel.

Thanks again."

gravelcycling,cg0nyk,Good gravel bike vs road bike - speed differences,"Hello,  
I have occasion to buy nice road bike and consider this, because I already have very good gravel bike - so the question is, what can I gain by buing road bike?  


My bike it's a Planet X XLS from 2015 and it's... CX bike. I've just transformed it into gravel bike and current specs is:

* original, full carbon frame
* original, full carbon fork
* custom-build, light wheels (\~1600 g) using DT350 hubs and DT R460 rims
* Ultegra 46/36 crankset (FC-6800) with additional 34 ring to exchange if I want something lighter
* 105 cassete 11-30 11s 
* CX70 front delaurier - it's compatible with 11s and works great
* Ultegra RX on rear, with chain stabilizer
* RS685 shifters and brakes - hydro with 160 mm rotots
* PRO PLT Discover handlebar with some flare (it's for gravels)
* M540 pedals (SPD)

&amp;#x200B;

And it's very nive like a gravel with WTB Riddlers 37. Also, I can transform it into road bike easily, just change tyres to slicks 700x25 / 700x28c. Then it's very nice, comfortable road bike. Also, it isn't heavy - with road 700x28c tyres weights about 8 kg (17,7 pounds)

&amp;#x200B;

But... I'm still not sure. I'm amateur, so many things aren't important, but there are some details:

* more aero frame in road bikes
* more areo brakes in road bikes
* probably lighter (0,5 - 1 kg? - but it's probably better to less my weight)
* better drivetain? But for me and road near to my home, this 46T is ok - there are no long downhills, and if I ride solo, 46Tx11 with cadence \~90 is very difficult and also high speed. I don't plan to run races.

&amp;#x200B;

So... is it worth it to buy road bike? 

Or just use this one bike, because it's good compromise: 3 in 1 (CX, gravel and road bike - depends on tyres which I use)."

gravelcycling,cd1fih,Need help on my new (Gravel)-Bike,"Hey there, 

First up: I am totally new to bikes, never owned anything specific except for my ~15 year old road racing bike I have since my Student days.

Anyways, I am not happy with my fitness (working a lot and at home playing a lot of video games) so I was thinking about buying myself a nice bike. I am doing some Yoga from time to time with my girlfriend, but well, that’s not helping my fitness. 

I am up for doing “a few hour”-trips on the weekends, not only on the paved street but also off-road, so I very quickly ended up on gravel bikes.

After a few days of research I found out the big names in the game (Bulls, Cannondale, Kona, Bergamont, Giant, Canyon). 
The last and this weekend I was driving the Bulls Trail Grinder, Kona Rove ST, Bergamont Grandurance 5 (wanted to try the 6, but nowhere in my area it’s been in stock) and a Giant ToughRoad. 

Out of those I liked the Kona and the Bulls the most. They were simply the most fun to drive. 
Next weekend I’ll try to get a ride on the Cannondale Topstone Apex, I’ve the only good things about it.

Anyway, I can’t really decide on the Bulls Trail Grinder and the Kona Rove ST.

—Bulls Trail Grinder
+ Huge wheels -&gt; good for grail 
+ Drop bar
+ Cable routing through the frame -&gt; easier cleaning

- Huge wheels -&gt; bad for the street?

— Kona Rove ST
+ Thiner wheels -&gt; better for the street?
+ SRAM Rival (as I am a beginner I don’t really know if the rival is that much better than the apex from the Bulls. Couldn’t feel a difference to be honest)

- Thiner wheels -&gt; worse for gravel?

————————

I’d like to hear some of your experiences / opinions on those two bikes / gravel bikes in general (maybe there is that one gravel bike mo one is talking about which is better than them all xD)

My Budget is up to 2000€

I am 28 years old and 193 cm tall

I am looking at the disc variants of these bikes. And I am seeing on my local classified app a few frames(no fork) of these bikes for about $400 each. Is disc really good or is just hype?

gravelcycling,cck34l,NBD - Giant Revolt Advanced 2,"Picked up my 2020 giant revolt advanced 2 today from LBS

it's my first gravel bike and my first carbon bike

originally wanna go with beige/red one since white/black/red are my color but need to wait 7 weeks to get the xs

that's why i decided to go with blue one and surprisingly it actually looks better than beige one IMO

super pumped and can't wait to take this beauty for riding!!

&amp;#x200B;

however, got something in my mind and hope you guys can help me with...

&amp;#x200B;

the bike comes with 420mm D-fuse handlebar which I read a lot people/reviews talking about good thing on this handlebar and was really excited to try it out

unfortunately my shoulder is only 34cm (i am a 5""3 female) and 420mm handlebar is a bit wide for me

so my LBS swapped the handlebar with bontrager RL handlerbar for free since it fits me better

however somehow i feel a bit of disappointed

for one the original handlebar is carbon handlebar and is much more expensive than bontrager one 

and also d-fuse handlebar is one of the reasons i decided to go with this bike

&amp;#x200B;

now my questions are:

1) is it normal that LBS swaps cheaper part even though it fits me better?

2) The smallest d-fuse handlebar is with 400mm. Will i be fitted with 400mm? my current rode bike has 380mm handlebar on that and i feel quite comfortable with that

3) I was told that some people choose to go with a size up handlebar for gravel bike to have better control. is this true?

4) should I just keep the original handlebar and maybe sell it online and buy a carbon handlebar?

&amp;#x200B;

Really appreciate if you guys can give me some advices!"
gravelcycling,ccjh93,Pedal/Shoe Recommendations...,"Hi Everyone.   A bit surprised I haven't seen this mentioned here lately.

I was surprised that the bike actually came in with basic pedals but I look forward to upgrading very soon.

I used to ride road so I am no stranger to spd pedals and probably will go that route again.  However, I am thinking mountain bike shoes might work better this time around.  I came across some shoes by Lake that really caught my eye but didn't see enough overwhelming feedback to click purchase just yet.

gravelcycling,cc7bxh,Spoke count on new carbon wheel build?,"Hey guys, I’m looking for advice on how many spokes I could get away with on a new wheelset. Here’s the info:

Rider Weight: 190lbs
Bike Weight: ~24lbs
Brakes: Disc
Tires: Compass EL 650b x 48mm
Rim: Light Bicycle RG722, 650b, 385g
Hub: DT Swiss 240s straight pull
Spokes: Sapim CX Ray
Terrain: mostly Oregon Cascades forest service roads. Steep but not too rocky. Also plenty of pavement.
Riding style: aggressive and fast but with finesse over bumps.

I’d love to get away with 24/24 as I hear these carbon rims are probably stiff enough to rake it. However my more practical side is saying 24/28.

gravelcycling,cc0wec,"I've got a 85 mile grave race in a few weeks, looking for some prep/training advice","Long story short, I'm a strong mountain biker who got into gravel riding a couple years ago.  I live in Vermont so I can climb and am not oppose to mindlessly pedaling uphill; I'm used to it.   
In a bit over 3 weeks I've got an 85 mile gravel race that will involve 8k+ of climbing.  The good news is I'm in good shape - I've been riding 50-100 miles a week of mountain and gravel all spring and summer and I feel like my fitness is solid.  I did a 60 miler last fall in under 5 hours and this year I've done a few 30-40 mile gravel and mountain rides at a decent pace and didn't feel too destroyed afterwards.  

The bad is I'm clueless about how much to ride or to prep in these last few weeks.  I'm going to keep my usual riding schedule but should I complete a ride close to 85 miles before?  Or do one or two 50-60 milers to get my body used to it?  

Also, what should I be doing the week before?  I was considering a 60 miler 6 days before the race and some shorter easier rides the days leading up to it.  Is that big of a ride too much 6 days out?  

Looking for some insight from those who have done similar length gravel rides and how they've prepped.  I know my mountain biking helps but just clueless about the endurance part of it.  Thanks!"

Does anyone else have an issue with your feet going numb? I find I can never get the perfect fit with these velcro straps/maybe its the sizing but my toes/front of my foot can wiggle sometimes in my shoe. I can feel the loss of power/just feels much worse compared to when I strap them down tight so my feet don’t move but then after about 10km-15km my feet start tingling and going numb which can’t be healthy especially on intense gravel rides when my HR’s buzzing, 

They’re size 13 US (47 eu I think) and all my other daily shoes have been size 13 for years. I’m a skinny dude so it could just be the fact I have skinny feet too but i’m not even wearing thin cycling socks as people normally do. Just regular nike dri fit ones. Should I just try wearing thicker socks or should I be looking into getting a new pair of shoes? Not really made of money but this is a very important part of my cycling experience so definitely willing to spend some to be comfortable.

gravelcycling,cao19h,New-ish Drivetrain Day?,"I was previously running 2x9 shimano 105 (not quite full groupset) and recently did a race where AbsoluteBlack was a sponsor and gave out new chainrings to a few participants. I was lucky enough to be one of the recipients, and decided to replace as much of my drivetrain as I could, with parts I've collected throughout the past year. I'm now running a complete frankenbike with:

* 105 flightdeck brifters
* 105 (3-speed, I think) front derailleur
* Precision billet rear derailleur
* New SRAM chain
* 48/32t AbsoluteBlack sub-compact chainrings.

Everything is working great, though I have a little tweaking of the rear derailleur to do. I'm not sure at this point whether there is a huge difference in oval chainrings (versus just having new chainrings), but the long ride I did on Sunday felt really good. Their literature, as well as other companies that make oval chainrings, state that you should climb easier and have less wear on your knees. I'm not sure I feel that at all, but I also had a little crash so I might be feeling that instead of the fatigue. No matter what, they're a HUGE improvement over the FSA Gossamer chainrings I was running. So far, so good!

I've fitted my gravel bike with a couple of bottle cages but I haven't bought any bags for it yet. Any recommendations regarding placement, sizes or types of bags? I'm really small so obviously my bike is really small as well, which limits the amount of space for bags somewhat. At the moment I'm thinking about going on longer daytrips, so I just need space for an extra layer, some food, a minimal tool kit and water."

I come from a mountain bike background, but have recently been enjoying long bikepacking tours on my fixed gear. I'm now ready for a geared gravel/bikepacking rig. I already have a Giant fathom for mountain bikepacking, but want something faster and designed for long gravel grinds. The cost difference between the two isn't really a point of concern considering that if I were to get the toughroad I'd have to spent a few hundred upgrading parts(tires,shifters, derailleur).

I want to be able to get rowdy as you can on a skinny tire bike but I also want to feel like lance armstrong on the gravel roads. The geometry spec on paper between the two bike is extremely minimal. The major difference being a 1"" longer chainstay on the toughroad. Does anyone have experience with either or both bikes? Thanks all and ride on!"

When reading a review of the new Cannondale Topstone, the top of the line version is shown with fairly wide tires and a 2x AXS system.

gravelcycling,c0m6i5,How many watts do you pay for riding gravel vs road?,"Hey there,

I'm a mostly N=1 sort of rider, and every 3-4 years I want to try something new. Last time I changed what I was riding I went from a Cannondale CAAD to a Trek Domane, and definitely liked a few things about it: slightly more comfortable geometry, room for bigger tires (I run 23s on the Caddy and 28s on the Domane), and the benefits of carbon.

What I noticed, too, was that I was much more like to go ""underbiking"" into the woods, doing more than my fair share of gravel and even single-track riding. Not optimally, of course, but it's been a hell of a lot of fun.

Now I'm looking at the Salsa Warbird Carbon and it seems pretty yummy to me: carbon, loads more tire clearance (28mm to a 40mm Panaracer GravelKing is almost a 50% increase in width), mounty stuff for fenders and bento boxes and fork thingies and racks and all the goodies.

Of course, the question is how much one loses. I watched this GCN video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr7u9hgUKJs

And it seems lime there might be a 5-8% difference in the two bikes. If I'm putting down 250 watts, then I'm looking at maybe a 20 watt difference from the bike, which doesn't seem like much. But then I thought I would ask here:

Has anyone compared wattage or route speed going from a road bike to a gravel bike, with a similar setup and geometry, and compared either watts or speed?

My running theory is that doing even more riding will neutralize the loss, but I'd be curious to hear others."

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the process of deciding what wheelset I should get to compliment the CRX 1 wheelset that the bike came with. In general, I want a gravel setup (not very roudy...easy gravel paths and the like) and a fast road setup (ideally road bike quick if possible). I have a second road bike (Cinelli Saetta) that I would like to sell in the near future if I can replace its functionality with the Revolt.

&amp;#x200B;

So far I have tried two setups:

&amp;#x200B;

1) 700C x 44 Snoqualmie Pass 

\-A plush setup and quite good for the dirt trails that I find myself on. I may consider something a little more aggressive when the tires wear out but certainly has not been needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) 25mm GP 4000 ii

\-Just tried this setup last night and it felt quite fast I think it felt almost as quick as my road bike but its hard to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I could go with a deep section set of 700c wheels for the road setup and use the CRX 1 wheelset as the gravel wheelset.  

&amp;#x200B;

Or, I could use the CRX 1 wheelset as the road setup (with the GP 4000 ii) get a 650b wheelset and get a bit more aggressive tire (like the Gravelking) for the gravel setup.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the wheelsets are pretty similar in price, so price is not really a consideration.

Please forgive the photography, haven't had a chance to take good photos.

gravelcycling,bwq98p,Tips to increase stack height for more comfortable drops?,"So I have a Specialized Diverge with it's stock setup with their normal shallow drops. I prefer the control and braking power when in the drops, especially when the terrain gets rough. I'd like to raise my bars a bit so I'm more comfortable spending more time in the drops. I was thinking of adding spacers under the Future Shock, getting the Specialized Hover bar with flare, and maybe getting a stem with an increased angle.

Anyone have a rough idea of how high to go? Maybe 20-40 mm higher? Or what have you done to achieve similar fit? And I know your not supposed to be in the drops 100% but I like riding in them nearly 50% time and want to optimise for them a bit more."

Also, any recommendations on a trigger lever for drop bars?"

gravelcycling,bw3f4o,Lost &amp; Found Race Report,"Lost &amp; Found 2019:

For those of us on the west coast, this is the big gravel race of the year. I've be training specifically for this event since January with my goal being to finish the 100+ mile course in under 7 hours.

Going into the race, the big concern was weather/course conditions. The Sierras had an enormous amount of snow accumulation and it just didn't stop. We were getting new snow up until a week or so before the race. Due to snow conditions, the course had to be rerouted. This took the long route from 106 miles down to 102 and cut about 1000' of elevation as well. Beyond that, there was a lot of rain at lower elevations. Looking at weather a week out, it appeared we could have thunderstorms during the race.

In the end there were only a few thundershowers in the week leading up to the race and the weather conditions on race day were perfect; lows in the mid 40s and highs in the low 70s. The course was a bit soggier than I would have liked, spots of mud and some slow, spongey ground in certain sections but overall, not too bad.

The race began with a neutralized roll out for the first three miles before turning off the highway and straight into the first climb, 7 miles and 2000' of elevation with most of that coming in the much steeper, final third of the climb. The pro pack absolutely hammered the first climb (the average in that group took 10 minutes off the previous KOM) and I got dropped almost immediately but hung in with some of the better age groupers. 

The first aid station was at the top of the climb and we all blew through it without stopping and rolled into a rowdy descent followed by a muddy traverse to the second big climb. At the base of the second climb was aid station #2 where I got off to grab a bar. I was back on my bike in under a minute and hit the climb.

This is where things turned south... No more than 100m from the aid station something felt funny and then my cranks seized completely. I looked down and saw that my BB had started to unthread itself. I turned around and coasted back to the aid station to try and grab some tools.

I have no idea what happened other than maybe Easton cranks and BBs suck. I installed a new BB a week out, greased it well and used a torque wrench to tighten to manufacturer's spec. Somehow between the peanut butter mud and bombing a 3 miles descent, I managed to loosen it? 

The tools at the aid station were decent but that BB requires a special tool to tighten it which they did not have. After 30 minutes of trying to use anything to get it tight, I decided screw it, hand tightened it as best I could and then wrapped the outer cup and BB shell with electrical tape in the hope of it staying put. I hit the hill but after 30 minutes of not riding, getting cold and bitten by thousands of bloodthirsty mosquitos, I wasn't feeling 100%.

I made it up the climb and through another 10 miles or so of rolling double track to the second aid station where I ran into my training partner. This was not a good thing. He was racing in the pro class and had his sights on a top 10 finish. I was worried he had a mechanical as well but it turned out, he dropped from the lead pack with a mile left on the climb and new he was out of the running so he decided to wait for me. Since I took so long to get there, he had a couple beers... and maybe a shot of whiskey... and was in quite good spirits.

Given his state and the state of my bike which now sounded like it was inhabited by a poltergeist, we decided to call it a day and just cruise in on the 65 mile route. The 100+ route took us on a big loop, far from help and I had no faith my bike would make it. It was a bummer but that's bike racing.

We took it easy, Z2 style for the last bit and I finished the ""65"" mile route (actually 62.88 according to strava) in a little over four and a half hours. It was definitely a disappointing day, suffering a mechanical and having everything go up in smoke after months of work but the ride was beautiful, the L&amp;F support crew was incredible as always and I drank an enormous amount of beers after. I'll be back next year, better than ever and with a very different crank/BB set up!"

Price in my country is identical. I tried both bikes for very short rides, and both of them felt super nice (no wonder, cause my old bike is around 10y old hybrid). My heart is leaning towards Scott (never had bright colored bike). But my brain says, that Cube might be a tiny bit better, has thru axles. Scott has quick releases with disc brakes, and some say it might be tricky. I know final decision is only for me to make, I just need some experienced opinions about those two bikes, maybe some insights about brands, possible issues etc. Thank you very much."

Basically my head went wondering toward what a MTB can do that it's not good/safe/etc/etc for a Gravel?

I cycle on tarmac, so have no experience with either MTB or Gravel. I don't consider potholes for the moment ;-)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested mostly from the structural point of view, happy to consider cyclist comfort, though.

I'm not talking about safety: cyclists safety comes to experience and wisedom, I'm not going down a valley if I can barely cycle :-)

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, I'm thinking: what terrains I should avoid with a Gravel, which a MTB can easily do?  


This might go down mostly to what wheelset and tires I've got, suspensions, etc.

So to narrow it down, I'll consider basic wheelset  and tires and any other feature found on bike at around £1000 / $1250 mark. Alloy.

The WTB seem appealing on price alone but I'd rather buy once rather than thinking only of price and being left wanting. As I understand the WTB / SRAM combo is decidedly lower-end whereas the Mason x Hunt seems to be well-reviewed at its price point.

gravelcycling,bnqcqg,"""Good Lord, Dad""--true story where I embarrass my daughter because of gravel cycling","My 13yo daughter plays saxophone in the school band. She is playing a solo in a music contest in a community college in a town about 60 miles away. Cool, I think. I'll just ride my bike there on the mostly gravel roads and when the wife gets there, I'll just change into clothes in time to hear the solo.

Now, I'm a native to my county and I know almost every gravel road like the back of my hand within 20 miles or so. This is 60 miles away and I do have to cross a state line. So I plot the route on Strava and download turn by turn directions into my old Garmin bike computer and I strike off at about 7AM. 

It had rained a lot in the last week, and I avoided all the low-water bridges I could, but I did have to cross one spot where my crank arms were submerged on the bottom half of the stroke. (I don't suppose I ""had to"" but it was fun so I did.

I get about 10 miles east of my destination and begin to head west except the ""road"" from the Strava map wasn't really a road. It was a two-lane path that heads over a hill into some pretty trees and country. ""Fuck it"" I think and head over it. It's probably an old township road that is no longer maintained. I climb a long hill, descend it on the steep side and see a gate across the road. There's purple paint on it but I think to myself, ""This is a public road and this dude is just keeping his cows in."" I throw my bike over the fence, climb it, and continue to pedal.

And things get interesting. I'm in a patch of trees. The road splits. I go one way. Dead end into a plowed field. OK, let's try the other. Creek crossing through mud. I shoulder the bike and push on. Another creek crossing. And another. And another. There are no cows, but there are deer tracks and coon tracks and turkey tracks everywhere. It's turkey season and I start to think about how I might be interrupting some dude's hunt and I begin to think ""Oh Shit."" 

The road climbs out of the bottom and I am at the edge of a nice piece of grass. And no road. I stop, check my phone map and I'm off where this ""road"" is supposed to be but I can't get back that way because there's a big pond (acres and acres) between me and the blue line on my phone's map. So I go the other way, hit a fence and turn to go along the fence. 

The pond has a fancy gazebo along the dam. Then I figure it out. I'm not on some dude's farm. I'm in some rich guy's hunting property. I pedal on. I can't go back now. I wind around, cross the creek a couple more times, but I definitely find some vehicle tracks. 
Finally, I pedal out to some buildings. What I feared was that I was going to come up on some people in their yard and have some explaining to do about how I got there and get arrested for trespassing.

A big metal building in the back of the place was quiet. No dogs. This big lodge-type house with deer antlers on every porch post announced the money. A 7-bay garage building sat behind the house. No one home. I throw my bike over the wrought-iron gate and climb it and I'm on the public road again, pedaling to my daughter's concert.

When I get there, my wife takes one look at me and says, ""what happened?"" I say, ""An Adventure"". I ask her which building of the college my daughter is going to play in. I grab my change of clothes and head to another building, hoping to avoid anyone.

So here's the scene. I'm barefoot with soggy feet. I am coated in mud from my calves up my thighs. I have padded cycling shorts on which are also muddy. I'm wearing a cycling jersey, spackled in mud. My hair is wet with helmet indentions on it. There are drops of mud on my face. One of my ears has a little dried blood on it from a scratch from a tree.

And there is my daughter and her entire band, hanging out. Her band director, a shy 24yo gay dude, stands agape. Kids avoid eye contact as I walk through. Parents are there and look disapprovingly at me. I used to be the principal of the school and I know all these kids and parents. And now, I'm wearing a coat of mud and clothes that might as well be an astronaut suit.

""Good Lord, Dad"", my daughter says. ""Hi Alisa!"" I say with a grin. ""Where's the nearest bathroom, Sweetie?"" I ask and she just points. 

I go into the bathroom, have a look in the mirror, and think, ""Good Lord, Principalman.""

30 minutes later, she got a 1, exemplary rating, on her solo."

gravelcycling,bmqvh9,19mm Rims,"I recently bought a used bike that I use for both hard packed gravel rides as well as road (60/40 gravel/road). The bike came with WTB i19 ST wheels. They say 29” on them, despite the manufacturer [stating](https://www.mangobikes.com/shop/bikes/point-ar/point-ar-tiagra/) that they are 700C WTB i19 rims. I’m 99.99% sure these are identical sizes, but not completely sure.

I currently run the slick 32mm tires that came with it, but they’re not ideal for the type of riding I do. I’m looking at 38 or 43mm tires. But I’m noticing that my internal rim width is smaller compared to most tubeless out there. I have literally only read good things about larger rim widths, and am at a loss as to why the manufacturer of a bike meant for “all roads” would choose a 19mm rim vs the 23 or 25mm options, which are the exact same price.

If anyone can let me know what I can expect when going to a larger tire, that would be appreciated. I must admit I’m a little miffed about how narrow the rims are right now, especially considering the cost to get a new set of tubeless-compatible wheels. Are they going to burp like crazy? Is their shape going to be like a lightbulb? Should I buy a tire width larger than I normally would, to anticipate the squeeze my rims are going to give them?

gravelcycling,blpvsm,New bike. Should i start by replacing the bar tape to dampen vibrations ?,"I've been riding my triban rc 520 the past week and every time i hit offroady and gravely place my hand start to feel numb. 
Since the tyre are only 28mm i couldnt lower the psi too much so i searched how to dampen vibrations even more. I came down to conclusions about what to replace first from easiest/cheapest to most expensive.

So let me know if i'm right but in order it's

Changing the position of my ride (arm angles, handlebar angle..) &gt; Lower tire pressure &gt; Bar tape &gt; padded gloves &gt; new tires &gt; carbon handlebar or this (https://www.giant-bicycles.com/global/showcase/d-fuse) &gt; Specialized future shock &gt; Lauf &gt; MTB ?haha

So since i've tried changing my ride position a bit last week (doing it by myself and i'm a noob so maybe i'm not doing it well) i'm no looking to replace the bar tape or even add one on top of my current bar tape. 

The triban rc520 have a thin bar tape it seems and i would love to add another layer.
So two question: 
1. Can i add the new tape directly on top of it ?
2. between VENTO SOLOCUSH TACKY (road.cc gave it a really nice rating) VS Lizard DSP 3.2 VS fabric Knurl Tape -- which one should i choose and why ?
I've picked thoses three because people often talk about them being really good dampener and they are in the same ballpark pricewise."

Seller is asking $1250 (USD) - which seems high. Unfortunately, I don't have a ton of other info to go off of - this is my first bike of this type.

There's a '19 that sold on ebay for 945 (1200 MSRP) and there's another '17 Renegade Expat for sale for localy for $800, but is in a smaller size.

gravelcycling,bietwe,"Finished my first race today! Green Swamp Gridah in Dade City, FL. To anyone on the fence like I was, just do it! Enter the race and have an awesome time!","Some pics at the bottom of this post. 

A few weeks ago I posted asking some questions about entering my first race. I was really on the fence and didn’t know if I’d have a good time, or if I’m in shape enough for it. 

But enough people gave me encouragement and put some of my fears to rest so I just did it and went ahead and entered. 

I’m so glad I did, and I think anyone who is interested in an organized race like this should just bite the bullet and do it! 

I managed to take 2nd in my age group. This has nothing to do with the fact that I’m a good rider, and everything to do with the fact that middle aged men dominate amateur cycling. 😂 I was more than 45 minutes slower than the guys in the 35-45 age bracket. 

Hopefully by the time I’m in that group I’ll be in shape enough to be competitive.

Things I learned:

Tire pressure is important. I was advised by a cyclist I trust to go down to around 40psi (even though I’m running tubed), and it made a huge difference. My average speed was up almost 2mph just because I could take the sand and bumpy sections faster. I didn’t have any flats, so probably could have even gone lower. 

Having a buddy helps. This older guy who seemed to be doing a similar pace to me offered to ride with me, and we helped each other out. Big morale boost to have another person to share the ride with and help each other keep pace. 

Cyclists are pretty nice people. Everyone I met was really encouraging and friendly. Any time someone was stopped on the course everyone would make sure they were ok and ask if they needed any help before riding on. I was worried people would be weird, cliquish, and too competitive, but I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome everyone was to ride with. 

Do your homework. I rode the course last week just to check it out and see what I’d be up against. You can’t always do that, but being familiar with the route and any obstacles you face makes it a lot less daunting. Even some google maps or street view research goes a long way to making you feel more comfortable while you’re out there. 

If you’re thinking of entering a race, just do it! I had a blast. Can’t wait for the next one!

gravelcycling,bglvne,Incorporating locals into gravel events,"There's a couple different threads of thought here, so bear with my rambling.

This might be my limited experience with gravel grinding, but there is an odd dynamic. Almost all of the riders I meet (including me) are from our metro (the Twin Cities of MN). We drive out of town to ride gravel, then we all go home. Events are based in small towns within a couple hours, but seem to be mostly run by people from the city. 

I grew up in rural, outstate MN so the disconnect between gravel riders and people that actually live there really stands out to me.



I was out riding on Sunday and thinking about how running an event would such a great fundraising and leadership opportunity for the local high school. I don't need to go into detail about all the logistical details that go into running a large event, but none of it seems outside the realm of what high schoolers (with some guidance) can plan. How great of an experience would it be for a HS senior to run a supported rest stop.  


Heading back into town, I was thinking about how because of this divide, the people of there have no idea the potential for fundraising. Another ride in my area, [Miesville 56](https://miesvillefiftysix.wordpress.com/), added a charity fund raising entry fee this year and collected $13,000 - and they were limited by their quickly met rider cap of 250.

This is more of an open question, but is there a divide in your area?"

gravelcycling,bg9zqp,Any advice for riding on sandy roads?,"I went for a 50 mile gravel ride today, but almost 10 miles of the route were horrible sandy roads where I lost traction, had to shift into the lowest gear, and put down every ounce of power I possessed just to keep the wheels spinning through the loose sand. 

In a couple parts the sand was so thick I actually had to dismount and walk my bike a hundred yards or so. 

So my question is this: 

Is this normal? Does sand suck no matter what? Or is there possibly some strategy I could employ to deal with it more effectively? 

For reference I’m running Gravelking SK 38mm tires, and in order to deal with the sand as best as possible mostly what I did was ride as far to the side or look for a line that seemed a little less deep sand, or even riding off on the grass when possible. But in some parts it wasn’t possible to go on the grass and I had to be on the road. 

Any thoughts about those horrible sandy bits are welcome!"

Most sources online say that the front feels ""twitchy"" while unloaded due to its steep head tube so what I'm wondering is how this feeling compares to to other types of bikes. I am currently riding an old road/tri bike, '87 schwinn supersport, so I am curious as to how the pack rat's handling would compare to this bike.

Also, this bike is marketed as a commuter/light-tourer but on paper, I don't see any reason I wouldn't be able to take the bike on regular 20-30+ mile rides unloaded while still being able to load it up with a weekend's worth of gear.

I just started riding some fairly easy single track with my Janis renegade explore. I want to get a tire that’s more appropriate than the clement x’plor mso 700x36 that came stock. There have been a number of loose sections and climbs where they don’t have enough traction.

I’m thinking about getting either the wtb resolutes 42mm or gravel king sk 43mm. The gravel kings look like they have better reviews, but the tread also doesn’t look much more aggressive than what I currently have. Interested to hear thoughts on which tire to go with."

I've enjoyed them quite a lot, but the amount of road riding I wind up doing wears them out so damn fast. For that, and improved rolling resistance, the ventures have looked very appealing. I was set on trying them out, but I have since learned about the teravail cannonball. These also look appealing, and I'm not left with the upmost confidence in the durability of wtb tires.

 I have a full squish that I know the geo. on.


 I have a Motebane Fantom Cross Comp that I do not. I do know it is a 56cm, but I have converted it from flat bar to drop bar and switched from 33c to 43c gravelking sk's.


 I am considering selling the Full Squish in favor of either a ToughRoad SLR GX1, Salsa Journeyman Apex 1 or Kona Rove NRB. I've only been riding for about 10months, and I think that the Motobecane is a tad too large for me. I'm 6ft, but long torso, 30in inseam. After 2 days or riding 10-12miles on singletrack, my back is absolutely killing me. Obviously my dad-bod has made me less bendy, so shorter reach maybe???

   I really like the ToughRoad, but have never ridden a 2x before though (I'm 45), so I'm a little apprehensive about learning the nuance of when to shift from the big ring to the little and being cordinated enough to be shifting the left and right at the same time. 

  My local trail system is mainly dirt singletrack flow trail with random whoops thrown in along with either a lot of roots or none depending on which trail. The fantom cross has handled the flow trail fairly well. The rooty one is fun on the squishy, but I don't travel to that one very often.

gravelcycling,bc339z,Pedal discussion,"Summary: Looking for recommendations on pedals, preferably SPD

Context: Yesterday discovered that the annoying squeeking my that my bike had been making was due to a partially seized pedal. Was running some fancy Ti spindle KCNC spd pedals (made by exustar) but have about ~1500mi on them of which only half was on gravel. Guessing the culprit was the weather sealing, so thats a priority.

While a good cleaning and re-greasing got them spinning again, there was some wear to the axle and its still a little gritty feeling when turned so not sure I should trust them (but will keep them as backups)

Wanted and still want something relatively light weight; but really want reliability at this point. Dont want single bearing / bushing type pedals again. Also not really in the mood to try something like the XPedo Mforce 8, though could be convinced.

Event here: https://gravelcyclist.com/training-rides/press-release-green-swamp-grindah-is-coming-to-dade-city-florida/

It’s been a goal of mine to participate in an event/race like this and see how it goes. I’m comfortable doing 50 miles, so would sign up for that length of ride. I don’t think I’m competitive in the sense of getting a top time, or anything, but I’d like to try the challenge and to be part of the event.

Here are my questions as a total noob who has never ridden in an official event like this:

1) I assume I need to carry all my own food and water for an event like this. No hydration stations along the way? I’ve got a frame bag and camelback to go in it, so I think I’m good on water. 

2) How will the route be marked? I’ve actually been to the Green Swamp to ride a few times on my own, and it would be easy to get lost in there with all the roads you can choose from. Will there be signs pointing at each turn, or will I need some way to view the route as I ride? I don’t have a fancy Garmin computer or anything, so what do people do to stay on the route if you don’t have a Garmin? 

3) On all the gravel rides I’ve done so far, I average about 13mph, which is considerably slower than my speed on paved roads, so it looks like it would probably take me almost 4 hours to complete the ride. Is that ok? Is there a time cutoff or anything like they have in some running races, like if you don’t finish in a certain time you’re swept up by a bus and get a DNF? 

4) I’ve never ridden 50 miles without getting off the bike. Is that what’s expected at a race like this? Or is it fine to ride 25 miles, get off, stretch, have some food/water, and ride the other 25? 

Thanks for indulging my questions. I hope someone with a bit more experience can shed some light on these types of events for me. I’m really eager to participate, and hope this one will work out for me!"

I am sort new to gravel bikes, since I live in Poland, the country of crappy roads, around 3 months ago I went against the current and instead of an MTB, I got myself a Marin Four Corners (I am riding it since January, and friends still call me stupid for a non-suspension fork). Considering the price range, the only solid alternative was a Fuji Jari 2.3, but I immediately dismissed it for a crank with a square-tapered BB. So here I am, with a 3x9 Hollowtech II crank that has a somewhat useless 50 tooth chain-ring, and I read stuff on the internet and people keep saying that road cranks make no sense on a gravel bike. 

Fair enough, but at least I have a 30 tooth granny gear for those steep wood hills. Still people keep saying something like a 30/46 is better and they recommend stuff, I check it out, and it turns out a 100 bucks worth of a crankset is on a square BB.

Now I have been riding those squares all my life and they have been nothing but horrible, getting loose, creaking and even damaging the frame. Yet I still see those on bikes that (at least here) cost plenty and I scratch my head. Is there something like a quality square-tapered BB? How do I even tell? Or is it like people are just ok with changing these twice a year, since it's low cost?

I mean, maybe crap components were all I had contact with all my life, or maybe, if you don't grind it too hard it will last, or are there really some quality parts I was oblivious of? "

Does the Trek Checkpoint sizing run a little large? I’m 6’2” and the Trek sizing guide recommends a 58 or even a 60 cm frame but when I tried a 58, I felt too stretched out with hardly any bend in my elbows. A 56 felt more natural and looked better to the LBS sales associate. 

I’m coming from mountain biking and I ride an XL Trek Stache, this would be my first road/gravel bike. Given I don’t have experience with this type of bike, I wanted to see what sizing experience for others here has been. 

So did you find the Checkpoint larger than the sizing chart suggests?"

The helmet has been great! Fit, weight, ventilation, all amazing. Perfect for those long pavement rides and daily commutes. 

As the weather gets better I’ll be venturing off the pavement more, which prolly means I should upgrade to more of a mountian bike style helmet that has more coverage. My thoughts are sticking with SMITH and going with a Forefront 2, but thought I’d ask all of you what you thought/recommend for both the pavement rides and off road adventures. Also, would you stick to one helmet for everything or switch off depending the ride? 

Note: My ride is a Norco Search. Fun bike!

I'm a competitive road rider who is looking to get into some dirt/gravel/crappy country road riding. Looking at what I want in a bike, I'd like to be able to switch tires and have a cushy but fast 19+mph group ride or spend a long day in the saddle over gravel/dirt/whatever I find while exploring. I live in North Carolina, so the sky's the limit in terms of road surface, and everything is at least slightly hilly (if not mountainous in the west).

&amp;#x200B;

What I currently cannot get an acceptable answer to: how does the ride feel of today's aluminum vs carbon on gravel/adventure frames stack up? I ride a carbon road bike, but unfortunately it can't even take 28mm tires so it's a nonstarter all around for comfortable rides on deteriorating roads. I used to ride aluminum and I know that the tech has come quite a ways, but is chatter still a problem? I know tire size (I plan on using something like a 34 for group road rides, and probably 40-42 for gravel focused) can help a bunch, but will it eliminate it? I don't really want numb hands/groin when taking in 100k in a state park.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also, at least slightly, concerned about weight. I know it won't match sub-16lbs, but man 22-23lbs worries me on gravel and a long climb...

\- Cannondale Topstone (probably the 105 version)

\- Cannondale CAADx or SuperX (maybe)

\- Specialized Crux

\- Trek Checkpoint (probably SL5?)

\- Trek Boone or Crockett (maybe)

Hey Guys i hope you can help me.

I bought for about 2 years a mountainbike because i thought i´m going to drive much offroad. But that was not the reality. The most time i spent on streets and only sometimes into woods.

After my Mountainbike was stolen, i decided to buy a Gravel Bike and join your community J 

I´m 1,93 metres tall and have about 95 Kilo. So i´m no lightwaight and maybe to heavy for a racing bike. I prefer a comfortable position for driving.

I ordered the new Canyon Grail AL 7.0 which has the new 105 Setup for a very good price. But they moved the order to a later delivery day. (have to wait till july now)

So actually i´m looking for some alternative because i won´t wait the half season for a bike.

I want to go with 105 (because i prefer streets and gravel) and an alu frame because of the price ratio. Currently looking for a price of about €2000 (yes i´m from Europe :-D)

&amp;#x200B;

I´m going to test all of these bikes..

&amp;#x200B;

Specialized Diverge E5 Comp – with the 105 Setup but what i saw without hydraulic breakes? Are the tektro breaks so bad? Could you give me your experience? I really like the colour. 30mm wheels looks very thin for a gravel bike ist hat right?

Cannondale Topstone 105 – as the name says with 105 Setup – overall a good setup and price but i don´t know about the colour. It does look quiet boring. 40mm wheels should be good to go in my eyes. Except the colour for sure a good decision.

TREK Checkpoint ALR5 2020 – 105 but what i heard so far it´s an old version of it? The rest of the setup looks well. 35mm wheels are also ok.

I´m kindly asking for your knowledge. There a so many bikes on the market and i can´t decide.

Thank you :)"
gravelcycling,auw1vz,Tire Talk!,"Let's talk tires! I'm going to be doing a few gravel races in the Sierras this summer. That means dry and occasionally loose (decomposed granite mostly), lots of climbing and some terrifying descents. 

I'm looking for a tire with low rolling resistance on hard pack and occasional paved sections, some bite for the down hilly parts and above all else, light weight!

The biggest issue I have found is that most gravel tires are kinda heavy. In particular, I really like Specialized's rubber but they just weigh a ton. Unless I go down to a 33c, I don't think they have anything under 400g. Suggestions?"
gravelcycling,aumhd8,NorthEast beginner events?,"Hi,

My GF wants to do some gravel events with me but all the ones I know of are a bit too intense (Farmer's Daughter, Cross Mountain Crusher, and Hell of Hunterdon are what I'm signed up for atm). 

Any recs for shorter mileage events or less climbing? Thanks."

gravelcycling,atbck7,Anyone got a Salsa Fargo they want to give me some feedback on? Looking for a steel monster cross type bike with a carbon fork and the Fargo ticks all my boxes,"Just to give context, I have a Specialized Diverge Carbon Tiagra that I want to keep as more of a road/gravel bike and I have a full sus mtb also.

Been searching for something along the lines of a drop bar hardtail for a while now, requirements are:

-Steel Frame
-Carbon Fork
-1x Drivetrain
-29er with as much tire clearance as possible

The Fargo tics all these boxes but not sure if it handles more like a hardtail or a touring bike, just looking for peoples experience with it."
gravelcycling,atajw2,Gravel fun!,"I got into gravel riding earlier this month when I got my Trek Checkpoint AL4 from my great local shop. I just wanted to say that I love gravel riding so much more than road, and I really enjoy road biking. It's so relaxing and exciting when I discover a new trail!"

gravelcycling,arq37z,"Wheel suggestions , nothing fancy","I’m looking to swap the wheels on my Specialized Crux E5. The originals got bent. I need some suggestions. This is the first time I explore upgrading wheels on my bikes. 

Budget? $500 $700 usd? 

How much more of an upgrade do you find spending $1K vs stock wheels. 

I’ll probably search used. "

gravelcycling,aqqpr5,700c gravel tires on a Salsa Cuthroat - has anyone ever done this?,"I have a Salsa Cuthroat that I will be using for gravel riding and want to run some faster and narrower tires than the 2.2in that come with it.

Looking into it, it seems like the rims on 29er and 700c are actually the same size, the difference is how thick the tires are. I might be dumb, but I always assumed that 29ers were bigger.

The wheels are sized at 23-622. https://www.wtb.com/products/st?variant=280907388

Any thoughts on this? Thanks!"
gravelcycling,aqqjj5,Specialized Sawtooth Tires,"Hi Guys,

So I picked up a new Specialized Diverge (all carbon, Tiagra model) and have been looking into tires. My bike came with Sawtooth Sports, where the next model up specifies Sawtooth 2bliss. 

So my question here is, does any information exist on the sports? Would I see a noticeable difference in switching to something like a gravelking or gravelking sk? 

My primary riding is 70-30 pavement and Iowa gravel. I hope to upgrade to Hunt gravel 4 seasons or Roval slx 24s to run tubeless in a year or so.

Thanks for the input."
gravelcycling,apxvqb,Di2 wires and battery,"I’m putting together a 1x with Dura Ace levers and an XTR rear derailleur.   I’m not sure on exactly what wires, battery and junction kits I need.  I’d also like to be able to scroll my Garmin with my left shift lever. 

Competitive cycle offers this
https://www.competitivecyclist.com/shimano-ultegra-di2-complete-wire-power-kit#

Besides the unit used for controlling the garmin is that all I need?  What unit do I need for the garmin control?  Can someone explain to me how all this goes together?  

Each lever has a wire that runs to a junction box in the bars?  Than that box has a wire that runs in the frame to another box in the BB?  The box in the BB than has a wire to the battery and another wire to the rear derailleur?  Where does the garmin control box go?  What is the box I see being used as a bar plug?  

Thanks!"
